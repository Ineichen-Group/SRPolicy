AB  - Patients suffering from opioid use disorder often relapse during periods of 
      abstinence, which is posited to be caused by negative affective states that drive 
      motivated behaviors. Here, we explored whether conditioning mice with morphine in 
      a conditioned place preference (CPP) training paradigm evoked anxiety-like 
      behavior during morphine abstinence. To do this, mice were conditioned with 
      morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 days. Twenty-four hours following conditioning, 
      anxiety levels were tested by measuring time in the open arms of the elevated 
      plus-maze. The next day, mice were placed in the three-compartment chamber to 
      measure morphine-induced CPP. Our results show that following morphine 
      conditioning, mice spent significantly less time in the open arm of the elevated 
      plus-maze and expressed robust morphine CPP on CPP test day. Furthermore, we 
      found that an acute treatment with (R,S)-ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a medication 
      demonstrating promise for preventing anxiety-related phenotypes, 30 min before 
      testing on post-conditioning day 1, increased time spent in the open arm of the 
      elevated plus-maze in saline- and morphine-conditioned mice. Additionally, we 
      found that the second injection of ketamine 30 min before CPP tests on 
      post-conditioning day 2 prevented morphine-induced CPP, which lasted for up to 28 
      days post-conditioning. Furthermore, we found that conditioning mice with 10% 
      (w/v) sucrose using an oral self-administration procedure did not evoke 
      anxiety-like behavior, but elicited robust CPP, which was attenuated by ketamine 
      treatment 30 min before CPP tests. Overall, our results suggest that the 
      ketamine-induced block of morphine CPP may not be attributed solely to 
      alleviating negative affective states, but potentially through impaired memory of 
      morphine-context associations.

TI  - Anxiety-like behavior in acute and protracted withdrawal after morphine-induced 
      locomotor sensitization in C57BL/6 male mice: The role of context.

AB  - Contextual memory plays an important role in development and maintenance of drug 
      addiction. However, little is known about of the role contextual memory in the 
      emergence of a negative emotional state in the withdrawal period. Therefore, this 
      study investigated anxiety-like behavior in acute and protracted morphine 
      withdrawal of mice submitted to a locomotor sensitization protocol and the 
      influence of contextual memory on this behavior. Male adult C57Bl6 mice were 
      subjected to morphine locomotor sensitization and anxiety-like behavior was 
      assessed by using the elevated plus maze test (EPM). To evaluate associative 
      memory, the mice were re-exposed to the context of locomotor sensitization 
      immediately before EPM. As expected, repeated morphine administrations promoted 
      locomotor sensitization, seen as a gradual increase in the distance traveled 
      during the acquisition phase. There was an increase in anxiety-like behavior upon 
      acute withdrawal, as indicated by a decrease in open arms activity (OAA), but 
      this effect dissipated over time. However, when the context was presented, mice 
      in protracted withdrawal showed enhanced anxiety-like behavior, indicated by an 
      increase in closed arms activity (CAA). This effect was context specific since 
      re-exposure in an alternative context did not change the anxiety-like behavior. 
      Treatment with diazepam counteracted the decrease in OAA in acute withdrawal and 
      the increase in CAA induced by context re- exposure during protracted abstinence. 
      Thus, repeated morphine administration induced a negative emotional state when 
      the drug was discontinued. The context associated with drug exposure played a 
      pivotal role in the appearance of anxiety-like behavior, even long after drug 
      discontinuation. There were differences in the patterns of anxiety behaviors in 
      acute (unconditioned anxiety-like behavior) and protracted (conditioned 
      anxiety-like behavior) withdrawal since the former was characterized by a passive 
      behavioral strategy and the latter by an active behavioral strategy.

TI  - Basolateral Amygdala SIRT1/PGC-1α Mitochondrial Biogenesis Pathway Mediates 
      Morphine Withdrawal-Associated Anxiety in Mice.
PG  - 774-785
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyac040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety is a negative emotion that contributes to craving and relapse 
      during drug withdrawal. Sirtuins 1 (SIRT1) has been reported to be critical in 
      both negative emotions and drug addiction. However, it remains incompletely 
      elucidated whether SIRT1 is involved in morphine withdrawal-associated anxiety. 
      METHODS: We established a mouse model of anxiety-like behaviors induced by 
      morphine withdrawal and then detected neuronal activity with immunofluorescence 
      and mitochondrial morphology with electron microscopy, mitochondrial DNA contents 
      with quantitative real-time PCR, and mitochondrial function with the ATP content 
      detection kit and the Mitochondrial Complex IV Activity Kit in the basolateral 
      amygdala (BLA). The mitochondrial molecules were detected by western blot. Then 
      we used virus-mediated downregulation and overexpression of SIRT1 in BLA to 
      investigate the effect of SIRT1 on anxiety and mitochondrial function. Finally, 
      we examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 on anxiety and 
      mitochondrial function. RESULTS: We found that BLA neuronal activity, 
      mitochondrial function, and mtDNA content were significantly higher in morphine 
      withdrawal mice. Furthermore, the expression levels of mitochondrial molecules 
      increased in BLA cells. Virus-mediated downregulation of SIRT1 in BLA prevented 
      anxiety-like behaviors in morphine withdrawal mice, whereas overexpression of 
      SIRT1 in BLA facilitated anxiety-like behaviors in untreated mice through the 
      SIRT1/ peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha 
      pathway. Intra-BLA infusion of selective SIRT1 antagonist EX527 effectively 
      ameliorated anxiety-like behaviors and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice with 
      morphine withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Our results implicate a causal role for SIRT1 in 
      the regulation of anxiety through actions on mitochondrial biogenesis. Inhibitors 
      targeting SIRT1 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of opioid 
      withdrawal-associated anxiety.

TI  - Modulation of anxiety-like behavior and morphine dependence in CREB-deficient 
      mice.
PG  - 1122-33
AB  - The transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) has been 
      shown to regulate different physiological responses including drug addiction and 
      emotional behavior. Molecular changes including adaptive modifications of the 
      transcription factor CREB are produced during drug dependence in many regions of 
      the brain, including the locus coeruleus (LC), but the molecular mechanisms 
      involving CREB within these regions have remained controversial. To further 
      investigate the involvement of CREB in emotional behavior, drug reward and opioid 
      physical dependence, we used two independently generated CREB-deficient mice. We 
      employed the Cre/loxP system to generate mice with a conditional CREB mutation 
      restricted to the nervous system, where all CREB isoforms are lacking in the 
      brain (Crebl(NesCre)). A genetically defined cohort of the previously described 
      hypomorphic Crebl(alphadelta) mice, in which the two major transcriptionally 
      active isoforms (alpha and delta) are disrupted throughout the organism, were 
      also used. First, we investigated the responses to stress of the CREB-deficient 
      mice in several paradigms, and we found an increased anxiogenic-like response in 
      the both Creb1 mutant mice in different behavioral models. We investigated the 
      rewarding properties of drugs of abuse (cocaine and morphine) and natural reward 
      (food) using the conditioned place-preference paradigm. No modification of 
      motivational responses of morphine, cocaine, or food was observed in mutant mice. 
      Finally, we evaluated opioid dependence by measuring the behavioral expression of 
      morphine withdrawal and electrophysiological recordings of LC neurons. We showed 
      an important attenuation of the behavioral expression of abstinence and a 
      decrease in the hyperactivity of LC neurons in both Creb1 mutant mice. Our 
      results emphasize the selective role played by neuronal CREB in emotional-like 
      behavior and the somatic expression morphine withdrawal, without participating in 
      the rewarding properties induced by morphine and cocaine.

TI  - Impulsivity-anxiety-related behavior and profiles of morphine-induced analgesia 
      in heterozygous reeler mice.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - Reelin is an extracellular matrix protein, secreted by GABAergic interneurons, 
      that provides a signal for neural plasticity. A downregulation of reelin may be a 
      factor to be considered in the study of major psychiatric disorders. The 
      heterozygous reeler mouse model, thus, may be important to reveal those 
      alterations in behavioral phenotype produced by reduced neural plasticity. 
      Heterozygous (HZ) and wild-type (WT) mice were tested for anxiety-related 
      behavior, motor impulsivity, and morphine-induced analgesia. Heterozygous mice 
      showed significantly lower levels of anxiety- and risk-assessment-related 
      behaviors in the elevated plus-maze during adolescence, in the absence of basal 
      changes in general locomotion. Adult mice were assessed for profiles of impulsive 
      behavior in operant chambers, and HZ mice exhibited elevated levels of motor 
      impulsivity. When mice were assessed in nociception tests, a genotype difference 
      in morphine-induced analgesia was found, and these results were confirmed by 
      measurement of mu-receptors in the midbrain. The basal behavioral profile of the 
      HZ genotype reveals important differences, consistent with decreased behavioral 
      inhibition and emotionality, which can be revealed as early as in adolescence, 
      together with slight increment of impulsive behavior and altered pain threshold 
      and at the adult age. The HZ genotype can thus represent a useful animal model 
      for the study of behavioral disorders consequent to reduced neural plasticity.

AB  - Opioid withdrawal generates extremely unpleasant physical symptoms and negative 
      affective states. A rapid relief of opioid withdrawal-induced anxiety has obvious 
      clinical relevance but has been rarely reported. We have shown that injection of 
      ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) leads to a rapid alleviation 
      of anxiety-like behaviors in male mice undergoing chronic morphine withdrawal. 
      Here we investigated the contribution of nucleus accumbens shell (sNAc) 
      parvalbumin (PV)-neurons to this process. Chronic morphine withdrawal was 
      associated with higher intrinsic excitability of sNAc PV-neurons via reduced 
      voltage-dependent potassium currents. Chemogenetic inhibition of sNAc PV-neurons 
      reversed the enhanced excitability of PV-neurons and anxiety-like behaviors in 
      these morphine withdrawal male mice, while activation of sNAc PV-neurons induced 
      anxiety-like behaviors in naive male mice. (2R,6R)-HNK reversed the altered 
      potassium currents and intrinsic excitability of sNAc PV-neurons. Our findings 
      demonstrate an important contribution of sNAc PV-neurons to modulating morphine 
      withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors and rapid relief of anxiety-like 
      behaviors by (2R,6R)-HNK, this newly identified target may have therapeutic 
      potentials in treating opioid addiction and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Hydrogen therapy is a new medical approach for a wide range of diseases. The 
      effects of hydrogen on central nervous system-related diseases have recently 
      become increasingly appreciated, but little is known about whether hydrogen 
      affects the morphine withdrawal process. This study aims to investigate the 
      potential effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) administration on 
      naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms and morphine withdrawal-induced 
      anxiety-like behaviors. Mice received gradually increasing doses (25-100 mg/kg, 
      i.p.) of morphine over 3 days. In the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal procedure, 
      the mice were treated with three HRS (20 μg/kg, i.p.) injections, and naloxone 
      (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was given 30 min after HRS administration. Body weight, jumping 
      behavior and wet-dog shakes were immediately assessed. In the spontaneous 
      withdrawal procedure, the mice were treated with HRS (20 μg/kg, i.p.) every 8-h. 
      Mice underwent naloxone-precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal were tested for 
      anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and light/dark box (L/D 
      box) paradigm, respectively. In addition, the levels of plasma corticosterone 
      were measured. We found that HRS administration significantly reduced body weight 
      loss, jumping behavior and wet-dog shakes in mice underwent naloxone-precipitated 
      withdrawal, and attenuated anxiety-like behaviors in the EPM and L/D box tests 
      after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal or a 2-day spontaneous withdrawal period. 
      Hypo-activity or motor impairment after HRS administration was not observed in 
      the locomotion tests. Furthermore, HRS administration significantly decreased the 
      levels of corticosterone in morphine-withdrawn mice. These are the first findings 
      to indicate that hydrogen might ameliorate withdrawal symptoms and exert an 
      anxiolytic-like effect in morphine-withdrawal mice.

AB  - Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with anxiety- and depressive-like 
      disorders. Its treatment remains a serious clinical problem due to the lack of 
      efficacy of the available therapeutic modalities. We investigated if the 
      activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 could modulate the nociceptive and 
      emotional disorders associated with persistent neuropathic pain and potentiated 
      the analgesic activity of morphine. The possible mechanisms implicated in these 
      effects have been also evaluated. Therefore, in C57BL/6 mice with neuropathic 
      pain induced by the chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve (CCI), we assessed 
      the antinociceptive, anxiolytic, and anti-depressant effects of the repeated 
      intraperitoneal administration of a Nrf2 inducer, sulforaphane (SFN), and the 
      effects of this treatment on the local antinociceptive actions of morphine. The 
      protein levels of Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 
      (NQO1), CD11b/c (a microglial activator marker), mitogen-activated protein 
      kinases (MAPK) and μ opioid receptors (MOR) in the spinal cord, prefrontal cortex 
      and hippocampus from mice, at 28 days after CCI, were also evaluated. Our results 
      showed that the repeated administration of SFN besides inhibiting nociceptive 
      responses induced by sciatic nerve injury also diminished the anxiety- and 
      depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain. Moreover, 
      SFN treatment normalized oxidative stress by inducing Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, 
      reduced microglial activation and JNK, ERK1/2, p-38 phosphorylation induced by 
      sciatic nerve injury in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. 
      Interestingly, treatment with SFN also potentiated the antiallodynic effects of 
      morphine in sciatic nerve-injured mice by regularizing the down regulation of MOR 
      in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus. This study suggested that treatment with 
      SFN might be an interesting approach for the management of persistent neuropathic 
      pain and comorbidities associated as well as to improve the analgesic actions of 
      morphine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that opioid use immediately after surgery 
      and trauma may worsen outcomes. In these studies, the authors aimed to determine 
      whether morphine administered for a clinically relevant time period (7 days) in a 
      tibia fracture orthopedic surgery model had adverse effects on postoperative 
      recovery. METHODS: Mice were given morphine twice daily for 7 days after 
      unilateral tibial fracture and intramedullary pin fixation to model orthopedic 
      surgery and limb trauma. Mechanical allodynia, limb-specific weight bearing, gait 
      changes, memory, and anxiety were measured after injury. In addition, spinal cord 
      gene expression changes as well as glial activation were measured. Finally, the 
      authors assessed the effects of a selective Toll-like receptor 4 antagonist, 
      TAK-242, on nociceptive and functional changes after injury. RESULTS: Tibial 
      fracture caused several weeks of mechanical nociceptive sensitization (F(1, 216) 
      = 573.38, P < 0.001, fracture + vehicle vs. sham + vehicle, n = 10 per group), 
      and this change was exacerbated by the perioperative administration of morphine 
      (F(1, 216) = 71.61, P < 0.001, fracture + morphine vs. fracture + vehicle, n = 10 
      per group). In additional testing, injured limb weight bearing, gait, and object 
      location memory were worse in morphine-treated fracture mice than in untreated 
      fracture mice. Postfracture expression levels of several genes previously 
      associated with opioid-induced hyperalgesia, including brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor and prodynorphin, were unchanged, but neuroinflammation involving 
      Toll-like receptor 4 receptor-expressing microglia was observed (6.8 ± 1.5 [mean 
      ± SD] cells per high-power field for fracture + vehicle vs. 12 ± 2.8 fracture + 
      morphine, P < 0.001, n = 8 per /group). Treatment with a Toll-like receptor 4 
      antagonist TAK242 improved nociceptive sensitization for about 2 weeks in 
      morphine-treated fracture mice (F(1, 198) = 73.36, P < 0.001, fracture + morphine 
      + TAK242 vs. fracture + morphine, n = 10 per group). CONCLUSIONS: Morphine 
      treatment beginning at the time of injury impairs nociceptive recovery and other 
      outcomes. Measures preventing glial activation through Toll-like receptor 4 
      signaling may reduce the adverse consequences of postoperative opioid 
      administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: L-theanine, 2-amino-4-(ethylcarbamoyl) butyric acid, an amino acid 
      detected in green tea leaves, is used as a dietary supplement to attenuate stress 
      and enhance mood and cognition. Furthermore, L-theanine induces anxiolytic 
      effects in humans. Recently, L-theanine was reported to reduce morphine physical 
      dependence in primates, suggesting the potential usefulness of L-theanine for 
      drug dependence intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine 
      whether L-theanine attenuates nicotine-withdrawal (somatic and affective signs) 
      and nicotine reward in mice. We also investigated the effects of L-theanine on 
      nicotinic receptors binding and function. METHODS: ICR male mice rendered 
      dependent to nicotine through implanted subcutaneous osmotic minipumps for 
      14 days undertook precipitated nicotine withdrawal by mecamylamine on day 15. 
      Anxiety-like behaviors using LDB, somatic signs observation and hot plate latency 
      were assessed consecutively after treatment with L-theanine. Furthermore, we 
      examined the effect of L-theanine on acute nicotine responses and nicotine 
      conditioned reward in mice and on expressed nicotinic receptors in oocytes. KEY 
      FINDINGS: L-theanine reduced in a dose-dependent manner anxiety-like behavior, 
      hyperalgesia and somatic signs during nicotine withdrawal. Also, L-theanine 
      decreased the nicotine CPP, but it did not affect the acute responses of 
      nicotine. Finally, L-theanine did not alter the binding or the function of 
      expressed α4β2 and α7 nAChRs. CONCLUSION: Our results support the potential of 
      L-theanine as a promising candidate for treating nicotine dependence.

TI  - Divergent modulation of pain and anxiety by GABAergic neurons in the 
      ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and dorsal raphe.

AB  - The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) collaborates with the dorsal raphe 
      (DR) in pain regulation and emotional response. However, the roles of vlPAG and 
      DR γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons in regulating nociception and anxiety 
      are contradictory and poorly understood. Here, we observed that pharmacogenetic 
      co-activation of vlPAG and DR GABAergic (vlPAG-DR(GABA+)) neurons enhanced 
      sensitivity to mechanical stimulation and promoted anxiety-like behavior in naïve 
      mice. Simultaneous inhibition of vlPAG-DR(GABA+) neurons showed adaptive 
      anti-nociception and anti-anxiety effects on mice with inflammatory pain. 
      Notably, vlPAG(GABA+) and DR(GABA+) neurons exhibited opposing effects on the 
      sensitivity to mechanical stimulation in both naïve state and inflammatory pain. 
      In contrast to the role of vlPAG(GABA+) neurons in pain processing, chemogenetic 
      inhibition and chronic ablation of DR(GABA+) neurons remarkably promoted 
      nociception while selectively activating DR(GABA+) neurons ameliorated 
      inflammatory pain. Additionally, utilizing optogenetic technology, we observed 
      that the pronociceptive effect arising from DR(GABA+) neuronal inhibition was 
      reversed by the systemic administration of morphine. Our results collectively 
      provide new insights into the modulation of pain and anxiety by specific midbrain 
      GABAergic subpopulations, which may provide a basis for cell type-targeted or 
      subregion-targeted therapies for pain management.

      anxiety-like behaviors in male mice.

AB  - One negative emotional state from morphine protracted abstinence is anxiety which 
      can drive craving and relapse risk in opioid addicts. Although the orexinergic 
      system has been reported to be important in mediating emotion processing and 
      addiction, the role of orexinergic system in anxiety from drug protracted 
      abstinence remains elusive. In this study, by using behavioral test, western 
      blot, electrophysiology and virus-mediated regulation of orexin receptor 1 
      (OX1R), we found that: (1) Intraperitoneal and intra-VTA administration of a 
      selective OX1R antagonist SB334867 alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in open 
      field test (OFT) but not in elevated plus maze test (EPM) in morphine protracted 
      abstinent male mice. (2) OX1R expression in the VTA was upregulated by morphine 
      withdrawal. (3) Virus-mediated knockdown of OX1R in the VTA prevented morphine 
      abstinence-induced anxiety-like behaviors and virus-mediated overexpression of 
      OX1R in the VTA was sufficient to produce anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. 
      (4) The VTA neuronal activity was increased significantly induced by morphine 
      protracted abstinence, which was mediated by OX1R. (5) OX1R was widely 
      distributed in the neuronal soma and processes of dopaminergic and 
      non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. The findings revealed that the OX1R mediates 
      morphine abstinence-induced anxiety-like behaviors and the VTA plays a critical 
      role in this effect.

AB  - The involvement of the opioidergic system on anxiolytic and antinociceptive 
      responses induced by cholestasis was investigated in cholestatic and addicted 
      mice. Elevated plus-maze and tail-flick devices were used to assess anxiety and 
      pain levels, respectively. The data indicated that induction of cholestasis and 
      injection of opioid drugs including morphine and tramadol enhanced %OAT and %OAE 
      but naloxone reduced %OAT and %OAE in the sham-operated and bile duct ligation 
      (BDL) mice. Induction of cholestasis and addiction to morphine and tramadol 
      prolonged tail-flick latency, which was reversed by naloxone. Coadministration of 
      morphine and tramadol enhanced anxiolytic and analgesic effects in the 
      sham-operated and BDL mice. It seems (a) cholestasis and addiction affect anxiety 
      and pain behaviors, (b) μ-opioid receptors play a key role in anxiolytic and 
      analgesic effects induced by cholestasis, and (c) cotreatment with morphine and 
      tramadol augmented the effectiveness of them for induction of anxiolytic and 
      analgesic effects both in cholestatic and addicted mice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infants exposed to opioids in utero are at high risk of exhibiting 
      Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS), a combination of somatic withdrawal 
      symptoms including high pitched crying, sleeplessness, irritability, 
      gastrointestinal distress, and in the worst cases, seizures. The heterogeneity of 
      in utero opioid exposure, particularly exposure to polypharmacy, makes it 
      difficult to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms that could inform 
      early diagnosis and treatment of NOWS, and challenging to investigate 
      consequences later in life. METHODS: To address these issues, we developed a 
      mouse model of NOWS that includes gestational and post-natal morphine exposure 
      that encompasses the developmental equivalent of all three human trimesters and 
      assessed both behavior and transcriptome alterations. RESULTS: Opioid exposure 
      throughout all three human equivalent trimesters delayed developmental milestones 
      and produced acute withdrawal phenotypes in mice reminiscent of those observed in 
      infants. We also uncovered different patterns of gene expression depending on the 
      duration and timing of opioid exposure (3-trimesters, in utero only, or the last 
      trimester equivalent only). Opioid exposure and subsequent withdrawal affected 
      social behavior and sleep in adulthood in a sex-dependent manner but did not 
      affect adult behaviors related to anxiety, depression, or opioid response. 
      DISCUSSION: Despite marked withdrawal and delays in development, long-term 
      deficits in behaviors typically associated with substance use disorders were 
      modest. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis revealed an enrichment for genes with 
      altered expression in published datasets for Autism Spectrum Disorders, which 
      correlate well with the deficits in social affiliation seen in our model. The 
      number of differentially expressed genes between the NOWS and saline groups 
      varied markedly based on exposure protocol and sex, but common pathways included 
      synapse development, the GABAergic and myelin systems, and mitochondrial 
      function.

TI  - Supraspinal neuroinflammation and anxio-depressive-like behaviors in young- and 
      older- adult mice with osteoarthritis pain: the effect of morphine.
PG  - 2131-2146

AB  - RATIONALE: Asteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of chronic pain in the elderly 
      population and is often associated with emotional comorbidities such as anxiety 
      and depression. Despite age is a risk factor for both OA and mood disorders, 
      preclinical studies are mainly conducted in young adult animals. OBJECTIVES: 
      Here, using young adult (11-week-old) and older adult (20-month-old) mice, we 
      evaluate in a monosodium-iodoacetate-(MIA)-induced OA model the development of 
      anxio-depressive-like behaviors and whether brain neuroinflammation may underlie 
      the observed changes. We also test whether an effective pain treatment may 
      prevent behavioral and biochemical alterations. METHODS: Mechanical allodynia was 
      monitored throughout the experimental protocol, while at the end of protocol 
      (14 days), anxio-depressive-like behaviors and cognitive dysfunction were 
      assessed. Neuroinflammatory condition was evaluated in prefrontal cortex, 
      hippocampus and hypothalamus. Serum IFNγ levels were also measured. Moreover, we 
      test the efficacy of a 1-week treatment with morphine (2.5 mg/kg) on pain, mood 
      alterations and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: We observed that young adult and 
      older adult controls (CTRs) mice had comparable allodynic thresholds and 
      developed similar allodynia after MIA injection. Older adult CTRs were 
      characterized by altered behavior in the tests used to assess the presence of 
      depression and cognitive impairment and by elevated neuroinflammatory markers in 
      brain areas compared to younger ones. The presence of pain induced 
      depressive-like behavior and neuroinflammation in adult young mice, anxiety-like 
      behavior in both age groups and worsened neuroinflammation in older adult mice. 
      Morphine treatment counteracted pain, anxio-depressive behaviors and 
      neuroinflammatory activation in both young adult and older adult mice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrated that the presence of chronic pain in young 
      adult mice induces mood alterations and supraspinal biochemical changes and 
      aggravates the alterations already evident in older adult animals. A treatment 
      with morphine, counteracting the pain, prevents the development of 
      anxio-depressive disorders and reduces neuroinflammation.

TI  - Memory impairment and reduced exploratory behavior in mice after administration 
      of systemic morphine.
PG  - 27-35
LID - 10.4137/JEN.S25057 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, the effects of morphine were examined on tests of spatial 
      memory, object exploration, locomotion, and anxiety in male ICR mice. 
      Administration of morphine (15 or 30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) induced a 
      significant decrease in Y-maze alternations compared to saline vehicle-treated 
      mice. The reduced Y-maze alternations induced by morphine were completely blocked 
      by naloxone (15 mg/kg) or β-funaltrexamine (5 mg/kg) but not by 
      norbinaltorphimine (5 mg/kg) or naltrindole (5 mg/kg), suggesting that the 
      morphine-induced spatial memory impairment was mediated predominantly by μ-opioid 
      receptors (MOPs). Significant spatial memory retrieval impairments were observed 
      in the Morris water maze (MWM) in mice treated with morphine (15 mg/kg) or 
      scopolamine (1 mg/kg), but not with naloxone or morphine plus naloxone. Reduced 
      exploratory time was observed in mice after administration of morphine (15 
      mg/kg), in a novel-object exploration test, without any changes in locomotor 
      activity. No anxiolytic-like behavior was observed in morphine-treated mice in 
      the elevated plus maze. A significant reduction in buried marbles was observed in 
      morphine-treated mice measured in the marble-burying test, which was blocked by 
      naloxone. These observations suggest that morphine induces impairments in spatial 
      short-term memory and retrieval, and reduces exploratory behavior, but that these 
      effects are not because of overall changes in locomotion or anxiety.

TI  - Sex differences in morphine-induced behavioral sensitization and social behaviors 
      in ICR mice.
PG  - 103-8
AB  - Gender and genetic strain are two prominent variants that influence drug abuse. 
      Although certain sex-related behavioral responses have been previously 
      characterized in ICR mice, little is known about the effects of sex on 
      morphine-induced behavioral responses in this outbred strain. Therefore, in this 
      study, we investigated the sex differences of morphine-induced locomotion, 
      anxiety-like and social behaviors in ICR mice. After morphine or saline exposure 
      for four consecutive days (twice daily), increased locomotion, more time spent in 
      the central area, as well as attenuated rearing and self-grooming behaviors were 
      found in morphine-treated females in an open field; no differences were found in 
      locomotion and the time spent in the central area between male and female 
      controls. When interacting with the same-sex individuals, female controls were 
      engaged in more social investigation, following, body contacting and 
      self-grooming behaviors than controls; morphine exposure reduced contacting and 
      self-grooming behaviors in females; in contrast, these effects were not found in 
      males. These results indicate that female ICR mice are more prosocial and are 
      more susceptible to morphine exposure than males.

LID - 26
AB  - Fifteen years after the discovery of hypocretin/orexin a large body of evidence 
      has been collected supporting its critical role in the modulation of several 
      regulatory physiological functions. While reduced levels of hypocretin/orexin 
      were initially associated with narcolepsy, increased levels have been linked in 
      recent years to pathological states of hypervigilance and, in particular, to 
      insomnia. The filing to FDA of the dual-activity orexin receptor antagonist 
      (DORA) suvorexant for the indication of insomnia further corroborates the 
      robustness of such evidences. However, as excessive vigilance is also typical of 
      anxiety and panic episodes, as well as of abstinence and craving in substance 
      misuse disorders. In this review we briefly discuss the evidence supporting the 
      development of hypocretin/orexin receptor 1 (OX1) antagonists for these 
      indications. Experiments using the OX1 antagonist SB-334867 and mutant mice have 
      involved the OX1 receptor in mediating the compulsive reinstatement of drug 
      seeking for ethanol, nicotine, cocaine, cannabinoids and morphine. More recently, 
      data have been generated with the novel selective OX1 antagonists GSK1059865 and 
      ACT-335827 on behavioral and cardiovascular response to stressors and 
      panic-inducing agents in animals. Concluding, while waiting for pharmacologic 
      data to become available in humans, risks and benefits for the development of an 
      OX1 receptor antagonist for Binge Eating and Anxiety Disorders are discussed.

      with elevated serotonin function. In human studies, Lsamp has been associated 
      with several psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, and suicide. Here, we 
      provide a more thorough characterization of the pharmacological phenotype of 
      Lsamp-deficient mice, including testing for sensitivity to morphine, cocaine, 
      MK-801 and ketamine. More thorougly, sensitivity to GABA modulators (diazepam, 
      alprazolam, ethanol, pentobarbital, TP003, and SL651498) was assessed. In brief, 
      Lsamp-deficient mice were more sensitive to the locomotor activating effects of 
      cocaine and morphine, and hypersensitive to the sedative and muscle relaxant 
      effects of GABA modulators, most likely reflecting enhanced function of α1 and α5 
      subunits of the GABAA receptor. No gross differences in sensitivity to NMDA 
      receptor modulators were observed. Thus, as the lack of Lsamp gene leads to 
      widespread imbalances in major neurotransmitter systems in the brain accompanied 
      by remarkable changes in behavioural phenotype as well, Lsamp-deficient mice are 
      a promising model for mimicking psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) may represent a promising therapeutic tool for treating opioid 
      use disorder (OUD). This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of CBD on the 
      behavioural and gene expression alterations induced by spontaneous heroin 
      withdrawal. Thirty hours after cessation of 8-day heroin treatment (5, 10, 20 and 
      40 mg·kg(-1) /12 h; s.c.), spontaneous heroin withdrawal was evaluated in CD1 
      male mice. The effects of CBD (5, 10 and 20 mg·kg(-1) ; i.p.) on 
      withdrawal-related behaviour were evaluated by measuring anxiety-like behaviour, 
      motor activity and somatic signs. Furthermore, gene expression changes of 
      mu-opioid receptor (Oprm1), proopiomelanocortin (Pomc), cannabinoid CB1 (Cnr1) 
      and CB2 (Cnr2) receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and tyrosine hydroxylase 
      (TH) and Pomc in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were also evaluated by 
      real-time PCR. Anxiety-like behaviour, motor activity and withdrawal-related 
      somatic signs were significantly increased in heroin-treated mice compared to the 
      control group. Interestingly, CBD treatment significantly reduced these 
      behavioural impairments and normalized gene expression of Cnr1 and Pomc in the 
      NAcc and TH in the VTA of mice exposed to spontaneous heroin withdrawal. Also, 
      CBD induced an up-regulation of Cnr2, whereas it did not change the increased 
      gene expression of Oprm1 in the NAcc of abstinent animals. The results suggest 
      that CBD alleviates spontaneous heroin withdrawal and normalizes the associated 
      gene expression changes. Future studies are needed to determine the relevance of 
      CBD as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of heroin withdrawal.

      accompanied by anxiolytic-like effects.

AB  - Morphine and related opioids are the mainstay of analgesic treatment, especially 
      in patients suffering chronic pain. Besides their antinociceptive effects they 
      may also exhibit anxiolytic-like properties that could contribute to pain relief. 
      The pharmacological manipulation of the serotonergic system may not only modulate 
      pain transmission and processing but also other behavioral effects of opioids. 
      The present study aimed to analyze the effect of the concurrent treatment with 
      citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on the antinociceptive, 
      locomotor and anxiety-related effects induced by acute and subchronic 
      administration of morphine in mice. Citalopram (15mg/kg) enhanced the acute 
      antinociceptive effects of morphine when concurrently administered as evidenced 
      by a two-fold increase in the ED(50) for the antinociceptive effect of morphine 
      in the hot-plate test. Chronic studies also revealed that concurrent citalopram 
      treatment (15mg/kg) delayed the development of tolerance to the thermal 
      antinociceptive effects of morphine. Additionally, morphine-induced 
      hyperlocomotion was potentiated by citalopram as assessed in the open-field test 
      and in the spontaneous activity recording in the home cage, a behavioral outcome 
      to which tolerance or desensitization was not developed. Interestingly, chronic 
      administration of both drugs promoted an anxiolytic effect as evidenced by the 
      increased central activity in the open field test. Future investigations on this 
      pharmacological interaction, such as the possible translational research in 
      clinics, might have consequences in future strategies for the therapeutic 
      management of pain.

AB  - Substance addiction causes anxiety, which in turn reinforces the maintaining of 
      substance use, resulting in a vicious circle. And this circle is one of the 
      reasons why addiction is so hard to cure. However, there is no treatment involved 
      in addiction-induced anxiety at present. We tested whether VNS (vagus nerve 
      stimulation) can improve heroin-induced anxiety, and made a comparison between 
      nVNS (transcervical vagus nerve stimulation) and taVNS (transauricular vagus 
      nerve stimulation) on therapeutic effect. Mice were subjected to nVNS or taVNS 
      before heroin administration. By observing c-Fos expression in the NTS (nucleus 
      of the solitary tract), we assessed vagal fiber activation. Using the OFT (open 
      field test) and the EPM (elevated cross maze test), we evaluated the anxiety-like 
      behaviors of the mice. Using immunofluorescence, we observed the proliferation 
      and activation of microglia in the hippocampus. And ELISA was used to measure the 
      levels of proinflammatory factors in the hippocampus. Both nVNS and taVNS 
      significantly increased the expression of c-Fos in the nucleus of solitary tract, 
      suggesting the feasibility of nVNS and taVNS. The anxiety level of heroin-treated 
      mice was significantly increased, microglia in the hippocampus was significantly 
      proliferated and activated, and the proinflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) 
      in the hippocampus were significantly up-regulated. Crucially, both nVNS and 
      taVNS reversed the above changes caused by heroin addiction. SIGNIFICANCE: It was 
      confirmed that the therapeutic effect of VNS on heroin-induced anxiety may be an 
      effective treatment method to break the "addiction-anxiety" cycle and provides 
      some insights for subsequent treatment of addiction.

AB  - Chronic opioid use changes brain chemistry in areas related to reward processes, 
      memory, decision-making, and addiction. Both neurons and astrocytes are affected, 
      ultimately leading to dependence. Passiflora incarnata L. (Passifloraceae) is the 
      basis of frequently used herbals to manage anxiety and insomnia, with proven 
      central nervous system depressant effects. Anti-addiction properties of P. 
      incarnata have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect 
      of a commercial extract of Passiflora incarnata (Sintocalmy®, Aché Laboratory) in 
      the naloxone-induced jumping mice model of morphine withdrawal. In addition, 
      glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) 
      levels were assessed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and DNA damage was 
      verified on blood cells. In order to improve solubilization a Sintocalmy methanol 
      extract (SME) was used. SME is mainly composed by flavonoids isovitexin and 
      vitexin. The effects of SME 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated in the 
      naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in mice. SME 50 and SME 100 mg/kg decreased 
      naloxone-induced jumping in morphine-dependent mice without reducing locomotor 
      activity. No alterations were found in GFAP levels, however SME 50 mg/kg 
      prevented the S100B increase in the frontal cortex and DNA damage. This study 
      shows anti-addiction effects for a commercial standardized extract of P. 
      incarnata and suggests the relevance of proper clinical assessment.

TI  - Deficient mitochondrial respiration in astrocytes impairs trace fear conditioning 
      and increases naloxone-precipitated aversion in morphine-dependent mice.
PG  - 1289-1300
LID - 10.1002/glia.24169 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria are abundant in the fine processes of astrocytes, however, potential 
      roles for astrocyte mitochondria remain poorly understood. In the present study, 
      we performed a systematic examination of the effects of abnormal oxidative 
      phosphorylation in astrocytes on several mouse behaviors. Impaired astrocyte 
      oxidative phosphorylation was produced by astrocyte-specific deletion of the 
      nuclear mitochondrial gene, Cox10, that encodes an accessory protein of complex 
      IV, the protoheme:heme-O-farnesyl transferase. As expected, conditional deletion 
      of the Cox10 gene in mice (cKO mice) significantly reduced expression of COX10 
      and Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (MTCO1) of Complex IV, resulting in decreased 
      oxidative phosphorylation without significantly affecting glycolysis. No effects 
      of the deletion were observed on locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, 
      nociception, or spontaneous alternation. Cox10 cKO female mice exhibited mildly 
      impaired novel object recognition, while Cox10 cKO male mice were moderately 
      deficient in trace fear conditioning. No group-related changes were observed in 
      conditional place preference (CPP) that assessed effects of morphine on reward. 
      In contrast to CPP, Cox10 cKO mice demonstrated significantly increased aversive 
      behaviors produced by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal following chronic exposure 
      to morphine, that is, jumping and avoidance behavior as assessed by conditional 
      place aversion (CPA). Our study suggests that astrocyte oxidative phosphorylation 
      may contribute to behaviors associated with greater cognitive load and/or 
      aversive and stressful conditions.

AB  - In the present study, the effects of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 
      citalopram and citicoline on morphine-induced anxiolytic effects were 
      investigated in non-sensitized and morphine-sensitized mice using elevated 
      plus-maze (EPM). Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration morphine (5 mg/kg) increased 
      the percentage of open arm time (%OAT, in morphine-sensitized mice), and open arm 
      entries (%OAE, in non-sensitized mice), but not a locomotor activity, indicating 
      an anxiolytic response to morphine. On the other hand, i.p. administration of 
      naloxone decreased %OAT (morphine-sensitized mice), and %OAE (non-sensitized and 
      morphine-sensitized mice), but not a locomotor activity, showing an anxiogenic 
      effect to naloxone. Moreover, i.p.co-administration of citalopram (5 and 
      10 mg/kg) and citicoline (75 mg/kg) induced the anxiolytic effect. Interestingly, 
      i.p. co-administration of low doses of citalopram (0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/kg) and 
      citicoline (25 mg/kg) significantly increased %OAT and %OAE in non-sensitized as 
      well as %OAT in morphine-sensitized mice, indicating an anxiolytic effect. An 
      isobolographic analysis of data was performed, presenting a synergistic 
      interaction between citalopram and citicoline upon the production of anxiolytic 
      effect in non-sensitized and morphine-sensitized mice. In conclusion, it seems 
      that (1) morphine sensitization affects the anxiety behavior in the EPM, (2) 
      μ-opioid receptors play an important role in morphine anxiolytic effect, (3) 
      citalopram and citicoline induced anti-anxiety effect, (4) a synergistic effect 
      of citalopram and citicoline upon induction of anti-anxiety behavior in 
      non-sensitized and morphine-sensitized mice.

TI  - The galanin-3 receptor antagonist, SNAP 37889, suppresses alcohol drinking and 
      morphine self-administration in mice.
PG  - 1-12
LID - S0028-3908(17)30087-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.03.004 [doi]
AB  - The neuropeptide, galanin, is widely expressed in the central and peripheral 
      nervous systems and is involved in a range of different functions including 
      nociception, neurogenesis, hormone release, reproduction, cognitive function and 
      appetite. Given the overlap between galanin expression and reward circuitry in 
      the brain, galanin has been targeted for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and opioid 
      dependency. Furthermore, the galanin-3 receptor (GAL(3)) specifically regulates 
      emotional states and plays a role in motivation, reward and drug-seeking 
      behaviour. We have previously shown that the GAL(3) antagonist, SNAP 37889, 
      reduces ethanol self-administration and cue-induced re-instatement in 
      alcohol-preferring (iP) rats with no alterations in locomotor activity or 
      anxiety-like behaviour. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SNAP 
      37889 reduces binge drinking and/or self-administration of morphine in mice. 
      Using the Scheduled High Alcohol Consumption (SHAC) procedure, SNAP 37889 
      (30 mg/kg) treated mice drank significantly less ethanol, sucrose and saccharin 
      than vehicle treated mice. Using an operant paradigm, SNAP 37889 reduced morphine 
      self-administration but failed to impact cue-induced relapse-like behaviour. SNAP 
      37889 had no significant effect on locomotor activity, motor co-ordination, 
      anxiety, nor was SNAP 37889 itself positively reinforcing. Liver assays showed 
      that there was no alteration in the rate of hepatic ethanol metabolism between 
      SNAP 37889 and vehicle treated mice suggesting that the reduction in ethanol 
      intake via SNAP 37889 is due to a central effect of GAL(3) signalling. This study 
      implicates the GAL(3) receptor in consummatory drive which may have wider 
      implications for the treatment of different addictions.

TI  - Hyperalgesia, anxiety, and decreased hypoxic neuroprotection in mice lacking the 
      adenosine A1 receptor.
PG  - 9407-12
AB  - Caffeine is believed to act by blocking adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors 
      (A(1)R, A(2A)R), indicating that some A(1) receptors are tonically activated. We 
      generated mice with a targeted disruption of the second coding exon of the A(1)R 
      (A(1)R(-/-)). These animals bred and gained weight normally and had a normal 
      heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. In most behavioral tests they 
      were similar to A(1)R(+/+) mice, but A(1)R(-/-) mice showed signs of increased 
      anxiety. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices revealed that 
      both adenosine-mediated inhibition and theophylline-mediated augmentation of 
      excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission were abolished in A(1)R(-/-) mice. In 
      A(1)R(+/-) mice the potency of adenosine was halved, as was the number of A(1)R. 
      In A(1)R(-/-) mice, the analgesic effect of intrathecal adenosine was lost, and 
      thermal hyperalgesia was observed, but the analgesic effect of morphine was 
      intact. The decrease in neuronal activity upon hypoxia was reduced both in 
      hippocampal slices and in brainstem, and functional recovery after hypoxia was 
      attenuated. Thus A(1)Rs do not play an essential role during development, and 
      although they significantly influence synaptic activity, they play a nonessential 
      role in normal physiology. However, under pathophysiological conditions, 
      including noxious stimulation and oxygen deficiency, they are important.

TI  - The Basolateral Amygdala to Ventral Hippocampus Circuit Controls Anxiety-Like 
      Behaviors Induced by Morphine Withdrawal.
PG  - 894886

AB  - Anxiety is one of the most common comorbid conditions reported in people with 
      opioid dependence. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHip) 
      are critical brain regions for fear and anxiety. The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) 
      is present in the mesolimbic regions involved in emotions and addiction. However, 
      the precise circuits and molecular basis underlying anxiety associated with 
      chronic opioid use are poorly understood. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated 
      that anxiety-like behaviors appeared in the first 2 weeks after morphine 
      withdrawal. Furthermore, the BLA and vHip were activated in mice experiencing 
      anxiety after morphine withdrawal (Mor-A). KORs in the BLA to vHip projections 
      were significantly increased in the Mor-A group. Optogenetic/chemogenetic 
      inhibition of BLA inputs ameliorated anxiety-like behaviors and facilitated 
      conditioned place preference (CPP) extinction in Mor-A mice. Knockdown of the BLA 
      to vHip circuit KOR alleviated the anxiety-like behaviors but did not affect CPP 
      extinction or reinstatement. Furthermore, combined treatment of inhibition of the 
      BLA to vHip circuit and KOR antagonists mitigated anxiety-like behaviors and 
      prevented stress-induced CPP reinstatement after morphine withdrawal. These 
      results revealed a previously unknown circuit associated with the emotional 
      component of opioid withdrawal and indicated that restoration of synaptic 
      deficits with KOR antagonists might be effective in the treatment of anxiety 
      associated with morphine withdrawal.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat and morphine decrease murine inter-male social interactions and 
      associated oxytocin levels in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamic 
      paraventricular nucleus.

AB  - Many persons infected with HIV-1 (PWH) and opioid-dependent individuals 
      experience deficits in sociability that interfere with daily living. Sociability 
      is regulated by the prefrontal cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit. Within this 
      circuit HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (HIV-1 Tat) and opioids can 
      increase dendritic pathology and alter neuronal firing. Changes in sociability 
      are also associated with dysregulation of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as 
      oxytocin or corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the prefrontal 
      cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the 
      interaction of HIV-1 Tat and morphine would impair inter-male social interactions 
      and disrupt oxytocin and CRF within the PFC and associated circuitry. Male mice 
      were exposed to HIV-1 Tat for 8 weeks and administered saline or escalating doses 
      of morphine twice daily (s.c.) during the last 2 weeks of HIV-1 Tat exposure. Tat 
      attenuated aggressive interactions with an unknown intruder, whereas morphine 
      decreased both non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions in the 
      resident-intruder test. However, there was no effect of Tat or morphine on 
      non-reciprocal interactions in the social interaction and novelty tests. Tat, but 
      not morphine, decreased oxytocin levels in the PFC and amygdala, whereas both Tat 
      and morphine decreased the percentage of oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons in the 
      hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In Tat(+) or morphine-exposed mice, 
      regional levels of CRF and oxytocin correlated with alterations in behavior in 
      the social interaction and novelty tests. Overall, decreased expression of 
      oxytocin in the prefrontal cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit is associated 
      with morphine- and HIV-Tat-induced deficits in social behavior.

TI  - Linagliptin, a Selective Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitor, Reduces Physical and 
      Behavioral Effects of Morphine Withdrawal.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27082478 [doi]
LID - 2478
AB  - (1) Background: Recent data indicate that receptors for GLP-1 peptide are 
      involved in the activity of the mesolimbic system. Thus, the purpose of the 
      present study was to examine the effect of the selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      (DPP-4) inhibitor, linagliptin, on morphine dependence in mice. (2) Methods: 
      Morphine dependence in mice was obtained by administration of increasing doses of 
      morphine for eight consecutive days, twice a day. On the 9th day of the 
      experiment, the naloxone-induced (2 mg/kg, ip) morphine withdrawal signs 
      (jumping) were assessed. Moreover, behavioral effects of short-term (60 h after 
      morphine discontinuation) and long-term (14 days after morphine discontinuation) 
      morphine withdrawal were observed. In terms of behavioral effects, the depressive 
      effect in the forced swim test and anxiety in the elevated plus maze test were 
      investigated. Locomotor activity of mice was also studied. (3) Results: The 
      administration of linagliptin (10 and 20 mg/kg, ip) for 8 consecutive days before 
      morphine injections significantly diminished the number of naloxone-induced 
      morphine withdrawal signs (jumping) in mice. In addition, the cessation of 
      morphine administration induced depressive behavior in mice which were observed 
      during short- and long-term morphine withdrawal. Linagliptin administered during 
      morphine withdrawal significantly reduced the depressive behavior in studied 
      mice. Furthermore, the short-term morphine withdrawal evoked anxiety which also 
      was reduced by linagliptin in mice. (4) Conclusions: The present study reveals 
      that GLP-1 receptors are involved in morphine dependence. What is more, 
      linagliptin might be a valuable drug in attenuating the physical symptoms of 
      morphine dependence. It might be also a useful drug in reducing emotional 
      disturbances which may develop during the morphine withdrawal period.

TI  - The Effect of Dihydromyricetin, a Natural Flavonoid, on Morphine-induced 
      Conditioned Place Preference and Physical Dependence in Mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a natural flavonoid, is used to reduce alcohol 
      hangover. It has a modulatory role on GABAA receptors with significant effects on 
      seizure and anxiety in animal models. We aimed to evaluate the effect of DHM on 
      morphine conditioned place preference (CPP) and withdrawal sings following 
      morphine dependence using animal models. METHODS: The effect of DHM (1, 2 and 
      5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; ip) on the acquisition and expression of 
      morphine-induced CPP was evaluated in male mice. Administration of morphine for 
      three consecutive days induced physical dependence. The withdrawal signs such as 
      jumping and defecation were precipitated by administration of naloxone (8 mg/kg, 
      ip). The effect of DHM on the development of physical dependence was assessed by 
      injection of DHM before morphine administrations. RESULTS: DHM, at the dose of 
      5 mg/kg, reduced expression of morphine CPP with an increase in the locomotor 
      activity. DHM, at the doses of 2 and 5 mg/kg, also reduced development of 
      morphine CPP. DHM alleviated development of morphine-induced physical dependence 
      at the dose of 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg by decreasing jumping and defecation. 
      CONCLUSION: These results indicated that DHM decreased acquisition and expression 
      of morphine CPP and inhibited development of morphine-induced physical 
      dependence.

TI  - Pretreatment with midazolam suppresses morphine withdrawal response in mice and 
      rats.
PG  - 685-90
AB  - AIM: To investigate the roles of pretreatment with midazolam on morphine 
      withdrawal in mice and rats. METHODS: Acute and chronic morphine dependence and 
      naloxone-precipitated withdrawal models were employed in the present study. 
      Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) content and Fos protein expression were 
      measured by radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Coadministration of midazolam (2 mg/kg, ip) and morphine prevented the 
      development of both acute and chronic morphine dependence in mice. Compared to 
      saline-morphine group (3.0, 95 % confidence limits: 1.9-4.3 mg/kg), ED50 of 
      naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping increased significantly in 
      midazolam-morphine group (10.4, 95 % confidence limits: 8.5-12.3 mg/kg) in acute 
      morphine-dependent mice (P<0.01). Pretreatment with midazolam lowered the number 
      and incidence of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping and prevented loss in 
      body weight in chronic morphine-dependent mice (P<0.01). Midazolam-pretreatment 
      inhibited the increase of Fos protein expression, not cyclic AMP content, in rat 
      spinal cord during morphine withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Midazolam suppresses morphine 
      withdrawal response by inhibiting hypersensitization of the spinal cord neurons, 
      and this effect may not be mediated by cAMP pathway.

TI  - Loss of Astrocytic µ Opioid Receptors Exacerbates Aversion Associated with 
      Morphine Withdrawal in Mice: Role of Mitochondrial Respiration.
LID - 10.3390/cells12101412 [doi]
LID - 1412
AB  - Astrocytes express mu/µ opioid receptors, but the function of these receptors 
      remains poorly understood. We evaluated the effects of astrocyte-restricted 
      knockout of µ opioid receptors on reward- and aversion-associated behaviors in 
      mice chronically exposed to morphine. Specifically, one of the floxed alleles of 
      the Oprm1 gene encoding µ opioid receptor 1 was selectively deleted from brain 
      astrocytes in Oprm1 inducible conditional knockout (icKO) mice. These mice did 
      not exhibit changes in locomotor activity, anxiety, or novel object recognition, 
      or in their responses to the acute analgesic effects of morphine. Oprm1 icKO mice 
      displayed increased locomotor activity in response to acute morphine 
      administration but unaltered locomotor sensitization. Oprm1 icKO mice showed 
      normal morphine-induced conditioned place preference but exhibited stronger 
      conditioned place aversion associated with naloxone-precipitated morphine 
      withdrawal. Notably, elevated conditioned place aversion lasted up to 6 weeks in 
      Oprm1 icKO mice. Astrocytes isolated from the brains of Oprm1 icKO mice had 
      unchanged levels of glycolysis but had elevated oxidative phosphorylation. The 
      basal augmentation of oxidative phosphorylation in Oprm1 icKO mice was further 
      exacerbated by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from morphine and, similar to 
      that for conditioned place aversion, was still present 6 weeks later. Our 
      findings suggest that µ opioid receptors in astrocytes are linked to oxidative 
      phosphorylation and they contribute to long-term changes associated with opioid 
      withdrawal.

TI  - Benefits of external qigong therapy on morphine-abstinent mice and rats.
PG  - 827-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To exclude possible psychological effects of qigong therapy in the 
      treatment of addiction effectively, morphine-dependence models need to be 
      established in mice and rats. METHOD: The effects of external qi on withdrawal 
      syndrome were examined in naloxone-precipitated mice and rats in three randomized 
      control experiments: naloxone-precipitated test in morphine-dependent mice (n = 
      100 in 5 groups, 20 mice each group); conditioned position preference test in 
      morphine-abstinent mice (n = 30 for 3 groups, 10 each); and naloxone-precipitated 
      test with paired box in morphine-dependent rats (n = 40 for 4 groups, 10 each). 
      RESULTS: These experiments showed that morphine-dependent mice, after external 
      qigong (EQ) therapy, had decreased incidence of jumping and lower jumping 
      frequencies, and attenuated loss of body weight. After EQ therapy, 
      morphine-dependent rats had reduced withdrawal scores and body weight loss was 
      inhibited. In the conditioned place preference test, the time spent in the 
      drug-paired box was significantly shorter for the qigong group than for the 
      morphine group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that qigong might have an 
      inhibitory effect on withdrawal syndrome, and reduce the dependence potential in 
      mice. Three different designs confirm that the impact of qigong therapy on 
      morphine-abstinent mice and rats is reliable and substantial. Further research on 
      the effectiveness and the mechanism of qigong therapy on addiction is warranted.

TI  - Treatment with 5-fluoro-2-oxindole Increases the Antinociceptive Effects of 
      Morphine and Inhibits Neuropathic Pain.
PG  - 995-1008
LID - 10.1007/s10571-020-00952-w [doi]
AB  - The efficacy of µ-opioid receptors (MOR) in neuropathic pain is low and with 
      numerous side effects that limited their use. Chronic neuropathic pain is also 
      linked with emotional disorders that aggravate the sensation of pain and which 
      treatment has not been resolved. This study investigates whether the 
      administration of an oxindole, 5-fluoro-2-oxindole, could inhibit the nociceptive 
      and emotional behaviors and increase the effectiveness of morphine via modulating 
      the microglia and activating the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 
      (Nrf2) signaling pathway and MOR expression. In C57BL/6 mice with neuropathic 
      pain provoked by the total constriction of sciatic nerve we studied the effects 
      of 10 mg/kg 5-fluoro-2-oxindole in: (i) the allodynia and hyperalgesia caused by 
      the injury; (ii) the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors; (iii) the local 
      antinociceptive actions of morphine; (iv) the expression of CD11b/c (a microglial 
      marker), the antioxidant and detoxificant enzymes Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) 
      and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), and of MOR in the spinal cord and 
      hippocampus. Results showed that the inhibition of the main nociceptive symptoms 
      and the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors induced by 5-fluoro-2-oxindole 
      were accompanied with the suppression of microglial activation and the activation 
      of Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling pathway in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus. This 
      treatment also potentiated the pain-relieving activities of morphine by 
      normalizing the reduced MOR expression. This work demonstrates the 
      antinociceptive, anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of 5-fluoro-2-oxindole, 
      suggests a new strategy to enhance the antinociceptive actions of morphine and 
      proposes a new mechanism of action of oxindoles during chronic neuropathic pain.

TI  - Novel proresolving lipid mediator mimetic 3-oxa-PD1n-3 docosapentaenoic acid 
      reduces acute and chronic itch by modulating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic 
      transmission and astroglial secretion of lipocalin-2 in mice.

AB  - Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) have demonstrated potent analgesic 
      actions in animal models of pathological pain. The actions of SPMs in acute and 
      chronic itch are currently unknown. Recently, n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) was 
      found to be a substrate for the biosynthesis of several novel families of SPMs 
      and 3-oxa-PD1 n-3 DPA (3-oxa-PD1) is an oxidation-resistant metabolic stable 
      analogue of the n-3 DPA-derived protectin D1 (PD1). In this article, we 
      demonstrate that 3-oxa-PD1 effectively reduces both acute and chronic itch in 
      mouse models. Intrathecal injection of 3-oxa-PD1 (100 ng) reduced acute itch 
      induced by histamine, chloroquine, or morphine. Furthermore, intrathecal 
      3-oxa-PD1 effectively reduced chronic itch, induced by cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
      (CTCL), allergic contact dermatitis with dinitrofluorobenzene, and psoriasis by 
      imiquimod. Intratumoral injection of 3-oxa-PD1 also suppressed CTCL-induced 
      chronic itch. Strikingly, the antipruritic effect lasted for several weeks after 
      1-week intrathecal 3-oxa-PD1 treatment. Whole-cell recordings revealed 
      significant increase in excitatory postsynaptic currents in spinal dorsal horn 
      (SDH) neurons of CTCL mice, but this increase was blocked by 3-oxa-PD1. 3-oxa-PD1 
      further increased inhibitory postsynaptic currents in SDH neurons of CTCL mice. 
      Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma increased the spinal levels of lipocalin-2 (LCN2), an 
      itch mediator produced by astrocytes. 3-oxa-PD1 suppressed LCN2 production in 
      CTCL mice and LCN2 secretion in astrocytes. Finally, CTCL-induced anxiety was 
      alleviated by intrathecal 3-oxa-PD1. Our findings suggest that 3-oxa-PD1 potently 
      inhibits acute and chronic itch through the regulation of excitatory or 
      inhibitory synaptic transmission and astroglial LCN2 production. Therefore, 
      stable SPM analogs such as 3-oxa-PD1 could be useful to treat pruritus associated 
      with different skin injuries.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat and morphine interactions dynamically shift striatal monoamine levels 
      and exploratory behaviors over time.
PG  - 185-204

AB  - Despite the advent of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of 
      people infected with HIV treated with cART still exhibit HIV-associated 
      neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND can be worsened by co-morbid opioid use 
      disorder. The basal ganglia are particularly vulnerable to HIV-1 and exhibit 
      higher viral loads and more severe pathology, which can be exacerbated by 
      co-exposure to opioids. Evidence suggests that dopaminergic neurotransmission is 
      disrupted by HIV exposure, however, little is known about whether co-exposure to 
      opioids may alter neurotransmitter levels in the striatum and if this in turn 
      influences behavior. Therefore, we assayed motor, anxiety-like, novelty-seeking, 
      exploratory, and social behaviors, and levels of monoamines and their metabolites 
      following 2 weeks and 2 months of Tat and/or morphine exposure in transgenic 
      mice. Morphine decreased dopamine levels, but significantly elevated 
      norepinephrine, the dopamine metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 
      homovanillic acid (HVA), and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 
      which typically correlated with increased locomotor behavior. The combination of 
      Tat and morphine altered dopamine, DOPAC, and HVA concentrations differently 
      depending on the neurotransmitter/metabolite and duration of exposure but did not 
      affect the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the mesencephalon. 
      Tat exposure increased the latency to interact with novel conspecifics, but not 
      other novel objects, suggesting the viral protein inhibits exploratory behavior 
      initiation in a context-dependent manner. By contrast, and consistent with prior 
      findings that opioid misuse can increase novelty-seeking behavior, morphine 
      exposure increased the time spent exploring a novel environment. Finally, Tat and 
      morphine interacted to affect locomotor activity in a time-dependent manner, 
      while grip strength and rotarod performance were unaffected. Together, our 
      results provide novel insight into the unique effects of HIV-1 Tat and morphine 
      on monoamine neurochemistry that may underlie their divergent effects on motor 
      and exploratory behavior.

AB  - In the present study, the effects of repeated intra-ventral hippocampal 
      (intra-VH) microinjections of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist or 
      antagonist on morphine-induced anxiolytic-like behavior were investigated in 
      morphine-sensitized mice using elevated plus-maze. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) 
      administration of different doses of morphine (5, 7.5 and 10mg/kg) increased the 
      percentage of open arm time (%OAT), open arm entries (%OAE), but not locomotor 
      activity, indicating an anxiolytic-like response to morphine. The maximum 
      response was obtained by 7.5mg/kg of the opioid. The anxiety-like behavior which 
      was induced by a lower dose of morphine (5mg/kg) was significantly increased in 
      mice that had previously received once daily injections of morphine (10 and 
      20mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 days. It should be considered that this treatment also 
      increased locomotor activity in morphine-sensitized mice. Furthermore, the 
      response to an ineffective dose of morphine (5mg/kg, i.p.) in the EPM was 
      significantly increased in the animals that had previously received nicotine for 
      3 days (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 μg/mouse; intra-VH), 5 min prior to the injections 
      of morphine (5mg/kg/day × 3 days; i.p.). On the other hand, the increase of 
      morphine-induced anxiolytic-like effect in animals that had previously received 
      the 3-day morphine (20mg/kg) was dose dependently suppressed by once daily 
      injections of mecamylamine (0.5, 1 and 2 μg/mouse/day × 3 days; intra-VH). It is 
      important to note that repeated intra-VH administrations of the same doses of 
      nicotine or mecamylamine alone caused no significant change in morphine 
      (5mg/kg)-induced anxiety-like parameters in the EPM. In conclusion, it seems that 
      morphine sensitization affects the anxiety-like behavior in the EPM and the 
      cholinergic system in the ventral hippocampus, via nicotinic receptors, may play 
      an important role in this effect.

AB  - Obestatin is a 23 amino acid-peptide, derived from the same preproghrelin-gene as 
      ghrelin. Obestatin was originally reported as a ghrelin antagonist with 
      anorexigenic activity, but later it was proven to be involved in multiple 
      processes including sleep, memory retention, anxiety, morphine-induced analgesia 
      and withdrawal. In the present study, in male CFLP mice, by using computerised 
      open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests we have investigated the 
      behavioural effects of the acute intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of 
      obestatin alone, and following ghrelin receptor blockage with [d-Lys3]-Growth 
      Hormone Releasing Peptide-6 ([d-Lys3]- GHRP6) or corticotropin-releasing hormone 
      (CRH) receptor 1 antagonism with antalarmin. Plasma corticosterone levels were 
      measured for each treatment group by using chemofluorescent assay. Our results in 
      the EPM test showed that obestatin reduced the percent of time spent in the open 
      arms. The basal locomotor activity (ambulation distance and time, rearing and 
      jumping) was not influenced significantly neither in the obestatin-treated 
      groups, nor in those receiving pre-treatment with antalarmin or [d-Lys3]-GHRP6. 
      The percentage of central ambulation distance however was decreased by obestatin, 
      while the percentage of time spent in the central zone showed a decreasing 
      tendency. The administration of antalarmin or [d-Lys3]-GHRP6 have both reversed 
      the effect of obestatin on central ambulation. Plasma corticosterone levels were 
      elevated by obestatin, which effect was antagonised by the injection of 
      antalarmin. These are the first results to indicate that obestatin exerts 
      anxiogenic-like effect in mice, which might be mediated through ghrelin receptor 
      and CRH activation.

AB  - Pregnane steroids, particularly allopregnanolone (AlloP), are neuroprotective in 
      response to central insult. While unexplored in vivo, AlloP may confer protection 
      against the neurological dysfunction associated with human immunodeficiency virus 
      type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-1 regulatory protein, trans-activator of transcription 
      (Tat), is neurotoxic and its expression in mice increases anxiety-like behavior; 
      an effect that can be ameliorated by progesterone, but not when 5α-reduction is 
      blocked. Given that Tat's neurotoxic effects involve mitochondrial dysfunction 
      and can be worsened with opioid exposure, we hypothesized that Tat and/or 
      combined morphine would perturb steroidogenesis in mice, promoting neuronal 
      death, and that exogenous AlloP would rescue these effects. Like other models of 
      neural injury, conditionally inducing HIV-1 Tat in transgenic mice significantly 
      increased the central synthesis of pregnenolone and progesterone's 5α-reduced 
      metabolites, including AlloP, while decreasing central deoxycorticosterone 
      (independent of changes in plasma). Morphine significantly increased brain and 
      plasma concentrations of several steroids (including progesterone, 
      deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and their metabolites) likely via activation 
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis. Tat, but not morphine, caused 
      glucocorticoid resistance in primary splenocytes. In neurons, Tat depolarized 
      mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cell death. Physiological 
      concentrations of AlloP (0.1, 1, or 10 nM) reversed these effects. 
      High-concentration AlloP (100 nM) was neurotoxic in combination with morphine. 
      Tat induction in transgenic mice potentiated the psychomotor effects of acute 
      morphine, while exogenous AlloP (1.0 mg/kg, but not 0.5 mg/kg) was ameliorative. 
      Data demonstrate that steroidogenesis is altered by HIV-1 Tat or morphine and 
      that physiological AlloP attenuates resulting neurotoxic and psychomotor effects.

TI  - Facilitating mGluR4 activity reverses the long-term deleterious consequences of 
      chronic morphine exposure in male mice.

AB  - Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of abstinence from drugs of abuse 
      is critical to allow better recovery and ensure relapse prevention in addicted 
      subjects. By comparing the long-term transcriptional consequences of morphine and 
      cocaine exposure, we identified the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 4 
      (mGluR4) as a promising pharmacological target in morphine abstinence. We 
      evaluated the behavioral and molecular effects of facilitating mGluR4 activity in 
      abstinent mice. Transcriptional regulation of marker genes of medium spiny 
      neurons (MSNs) allowed best discriminating between 4-week morphine and cocaine 
      abstinence in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Among these markers, Grm4, encoding 
      mGluR4, displayed down-regulated expression in the caudate putamen and NAc of 
      morphine, but not cocaine, abstinent mice. Chronic administration of the mGluR4 
      positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0155041 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) rescued social 
      behavior, normalized stereotypies and anxiety and blunted locomotor sensitization 
      in morphine abstinent mice. This treatment improved social preference but 
      increased stereotypies in cocaine abstinent mice. Finally, the beneficial 
      behavioral effects of VU0155041 treatment in morphine abstinent mice were 
      correlated with restored expression of key MSN and neural activity marker genes 
      in the NAc. This study reports that chronic administration of the mGluR4 PAM 
      VU0155041 relieves long-term deleterious consequences of morphine exposure. It 
      illustrates the neurobiological differences between opiate and psychostimulant 
      abstinence and points to pharmacological repression of excessive activity of 
      D2-MSNs in the NAc as a promising therapeutic lever in drug addiction.

AB  - The opioid epidemic led to an increase in the number of neonatal opioid 
      withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) cases in infants born to opioid-dependent mothers. 
      Hallmark features of NOWS include weight loss, severe irritability, respiratory 
      problems, and sleep fragmentation. Mouse models provide an opportunity to 
      identify brain mechanisms that contribute to NOWS. Neonatal outbred Swiss Webster 
      Cartworth Farms White (CFW) mice were administered morphine (15 mg/kg, s.c.) 
      twice daily from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14, an approximation of the third 
      trimester of human gestation. Female and male mice underwent behavioral testing 
      on P7 and P14 to determine the impact of opioid exposure on anxiety and pain 
      sensitivity. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and daily body weights were also 
      recorded. Brainstems containing pons and medulla were collected during morphine 
      withdrawal on P14 for RNA sequencing. Morphine induced weight loss from P2 to 
      P14, which persisted during adolescence (P21) and adulthood (P50). USVs markedly 
      increased at P7 in females, emerging earlier than males. On P7 and P14, both 
      morphine-exposed female and male mice displayed hyperalgesia on the hot plate and 
      tail-flick assays, with females showing greater hyperalgesia than males. 
      Morphine-exposed mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the open-field 
      arena on P21. Transcriptome analysis of the brainstem, an area implicated in 
      opioid withdrawal and NOWS, identified pathways enriched for noradrenergic 
      signaling in females and males. We also found sex-specific pathways related to 
      mitochondrial function and neurodevelopment in females and circadian entrainment 
      in males. Sex-specific transcriptomic neuroadaptations implicate unique 
      neurobiological mechanisms underlying NOWS-like behaviors.

TI  - Impact of the metabotropic glutamate receptor7 (mGlu(7)) allosteric agonist, 
      AMN082, on fear learning and memory and anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the influence of AMN082, the 
      metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 7 (mGlu(7)) allosteric agonist on 
      different stages of memory processes connected with fear conditioning in the 
      passive avoidance (PA) learning task in mice and negative emotional state 
      (anxiety-like) induced by ethanol- and morphine-withdrawal in the elevated plus 
      maze (EPM) test in rats. To perform the PA test, AMN082 (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, 
      i. p.) was injected to interfere with (or inhibit) acquisition, consolidation, 
      and retrieval processes. The retention latency in each group was recorded using a 
      step-through passive avoidance task 24 h after training. In turn, in ethanol- and 
      morphine-withdrawal rats, the influence of AMN082 on anxiety-like behavior was 
      estimated in the EPM test 24 h- (ethanol) and 72- h (morphine) after the last 
      dose of repeated drug administrations. In all experimental groups, AMN082 at the 
      dose of 5 mg/kg significantly decreased the step-through latency of long-term 
      memory in the PA task. These AMN082 effects were reversed by MMPIP (10 mg/kg), 
      the antagonist of mGlu(7) receptor. AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) also decreased 
      ethanol- and morphine withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in the EPM test, 
      and this AMN082 (5 mg/kg) effect was counteracted by MMPIP pretreatment. Taken 
      together, the results show that mGlu(7) is involved in fear learning to the 
      context and anxiety-like state connected with unpleasant experiences after 
      ethanol- and morphine withdrawal in rodents. However, it appears that functional 
      dissociation exists between these two AMN082 effects.

TI  - HCN1 in the lateral habenula contributes to morphine abstinence-induced 
      anxiety-like behaviors in male mice.

AB  - Anxiety disorders, common symptoms during morphine withdrawal, are important 
      negative reinforcement factors leading to relapse. Lateral habenula serves as a 
      negative reinforcement center, however its role in morphine withdrawal-induced 
      anxiety remains uncovered. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic 
      nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels have been reported to be important in emotion 
      processing and addiction, but the role of HCN in anxiety from drug protracted 
      abstinence remains elusive. In this study, by using behavioral test, Western 
      blot, immunofluorescence, electrophysiology and virus-mediated regulation of HCN, 
      we found that: (1) Intra-LHb injection of selective HCN blocker ZD7288 alleviated 
      anxiety-like behaviors in morphine protracted abstinent male mice. (2) The LHb 
      neuronal activity was increased by morphine protracted abstinence. (3) LHb 
      neurons were inhibited by ZD7288 and activated by 8-Br-cAMP respectively, which 
      were enhanced by morphine withdrawal. (4) HCN1 in the LHb was upregulated by 
      morphine withdrawal. (5) Virus-mediated overexpression of HCN1 in the LHb was 
      sufficient to produce anxiety-like behaviors in male mice and virus-mediated 
      knockdown of HCN1 in the LHb prevented the anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. 
      The findings reveal that selective blockade of HCN1 channels in the LHb may 
      represent a therapeutic approach to morphine withdrawal-induced anxiety.

TI  - Central HIV-1 Tat exposure elevates anxiety and fear conditioned responses of 
      male mice concurrent with altered mu-opioid receptor-mediated G-protein 
      activation and β-arrestin 2 activity in the forebrain.

AB  - Co-exposure to opiates and HIV/HIV proteins results in enhanced CNS morphological 
      and behavioral deficits in HIV(+) individuals and in animal models. Opiates with 
      abuse liability, such as heroin and morphine, bind preferentially to and have 
      pharmacological actions through μ-opioid-receptors (MORs). The mechanisms 
      underlying opiate-HIV interactions are not understood. Exposure to the HIV-1 
      transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein causes neurodegenerative outcomes 
      that parallel many aspects of the human disease. We have also observed that in 
      vivo exposure to Tat results in apparent changes in morphine efficacy, and thus 
      have hypothesized that HIV proteins might alter MOR activation. To test our 
      hypothesis, MOR-mediated G-protein activation was determined in 
      neuroAIDS-relevant forebrain regions of transgenic mice with inducible CNS 
      expression of HIV-1 Tat. G-protein activation was assessed by MOR 
      agonist-stimulated [(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPγS) 
      autoradiography in brain sections, and in concentration-effect curves of MOR 
      agonist-stimulated [(35)S]GTPγS binding in membranes isolated from specific brain 
      regions. Comparative studies were done using the MOR-selective agonist DAMGO 
      ([D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin) and a more clinically relevant 
      agonist, morphine. Tat exposure reduced MOR-mediated G-protein activation in an 
      agonist, time, and regionally dependent manner. Levels of the GPCR regulatory 
      protein β-arrestin-2, which is involved in MOR desensitization, were found to be 
      elevated in only one affected brain region, the amygdala; amygdalar β-arrestin-2 
      also showed a significantly increased association with MOR by 
      co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting decreased availability of MOR. Interestingly, 
      this correlated with changes in anxiety and fear-conditioned extinction, 
      behaviors that have substantial amygdalar input. We propose that HIV-1 Tat alters 
      the intrinsic capacity of MOR to signal in response to agonist binding, possibly 
      via a mechanism involving altered expression and/or function of β-arrestin-2.

      and psychostimulants. We previously showed that protracted abstinence to opiates 
      leads to despair behavior and social withdrawal in mice, and we identified a 
      transcriptional signature in the extended amygdala that was also present in 
      animals abstinent from nicotine, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and alcohol. Here 
      we examined whether protracted abstinence to these four drugs would also share 
      common behavioral features, and eventually differ from abstinence to the 
      prototypic psychostimulant cocaine. We found similar reduced social recognition, 
      increased motor stereotypies and increased anxiety with relevant c-fos response 
      alterations in morphine, nicotine, THC and alcohol abstinent mice. Protracted 
      abstinence to cocaine, however, led to strikingly distinct, mostly opposing 
      adaptations at all levels, including behavioral responses, neuronal activation 
      and gene expression. Together, these data further document the existence of 
      common hallmarks for protracted abstinence to opiates, nicotine, THC and alcohol 
      that develop within motivation/emotion brain circuits. In our model, however, 
      these do not apply to cocaine, supporting the notion of unique mechanisms in 
      psychostimulant abuse.

AB  - Mice subjected to morphine locomotor sensitization develop increased 
      anxiety-behavior expression during protracted morphine withdrawal. This 
      behavioral change is dependent on reexposure to the context of locomotor 
      sensitization and reflects a state of conditioned anxiety. In this study, the 
      effect of memory reconsolidation on the expression of conditioned anxiety in mice 
      with protracted morphine withdrawal was examined. Five experimental protocols 
      involving male C57BL/6 mice were used in which the animals were subjected to 
      locomotor sensitization induced by morphine and reexposed to the context 
      associated with the drug effect 28 days after locomotor sensitization and 
      immediately after subjected to elevated plus maze. In experiment 1, mice were 
      subjected or not to memory reactivation session and was observed that memory 
      reactivation 27 days after sensitization reduced conditioned anxiety. In 
      experiment 2, mice were subjected to memory reactivation, 24 h, 6 h or 1 h before 
      contextual reexposure, and the effect of memory reactivation coincided with the 
      temporal requirement for reconsolidation. In experiment 3, which involved 
      exposure to a situation of acute stress immediately before memory reactivation, 
      the mice demonstrated a return to increased conditioned anxiety. To confirm the 
      influence of reconsolidation, in experiments 4 and 5, mice subjected to memory 
      reactivation were treated with Nimodipine, diazepam or cyclohexamine, substances 
      commonly used as pharmacological controls in reconsolidation experiments. 
      Treatment with each substance separately inhibited the effect of reactivation in 
      experiment 5 (presence of acute stressor) but not in experiment 4 (absence of 
      acute stressor). These results suggest that, in our experimental model, 
      reconsolidation is mediated through updating of the emotional valence of 
      contextual memory associated with the administration of morphine.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat Dysregulates the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Stress Axis and 
      Potentiates Oxycodone-Mediated Psychomotor and Anxiety-Like Behavior of Male 
      Mice.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21218212 [doi]
LID - 8212
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with co-morbid affective and 
      stress-sensitive neuropsychiatric disorders that may be related to dysfunction of 
      the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. The HPA axis is perturbed 
      in up to 46% of HIV patients, but the mechanisms are not known. The neurotoxic 
      HIV-1 regulatory protein, trans-activator of transcription (Tat), may contribute. 
      We hypothesized that HPA dysregulation may contribute to Tat-mediated 
      interactions with oxycodone, a clinically-used opioid often prescribed to HIV 
      patients. In transgenic male mice, Tat expression produced significantly higher 
      basal corticosterone levels with adrenal insufficiency in response to a natural 
      stressor or pharmacological blockade of HPA feedback, recapitulating the clinical 
      phenotype. On acute exposure, HIV-1 Tat interacted with oxycodone to potentiate 
      psychomotor and anxiety like-behavior in an open field and light-dark transition 
      tasks, whereas repeated exposure sensitized stress-related psychomotor behavior 
      and the HPA stress response. Pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid receptors 
      (GR) partially-restored the stress response and decreased oxycodone-mediated 
      psychomotor behavior in Tat-expressing mice, implicating GR in these effects. 
      Blocking corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors reduced anxiety-like 
      behavior in mice that were exposed to oxycodone. Together, these effects support 
      the notion that Tat exposure can dysregulate the HPA axis, potentially raising 
      vulnerability to stress-related substance use and affective disorders.

AB  - RATIONALE: The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the neurobiological 
      mechanism underlying drug addiction, especially the primary rewarding 
      dopamine-dependent processes. Therefore, endocannabinoid receptor antagonists, 
      such as the CB1 cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant, have been proposed as 
      candidates for preventive addiction therapies. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the 
      possible involvement of CB1 receptors in the development of behavioral 
      sensitization to ethanol, morphine and cocaine in mice. METHODS: We compared the 
      effects of different doses of rimonabant (0.3, 1, 3 and 10mg/kg) on spontaneous 
      locomotor activity in the open-field, hyperlocomotion induced by acute 
      administration of ethanol (1.8g/kg), morphine (20mg/kg) or cocaine (10mg/kg) and 
      on subsequent drug-induced locomotor sensitization using a two-injection protocol 
      in mice. We also investigated a possible depressive-like effect of an acute 
      rimonabant challenge at the highest dose and its potential anxiogenic property. 
      RESULTS: At the highest dose, rimonabant abolished ethanol- and cocaine-induced 
      hyperlocomotion and behavioral sensitization without modifying spontaneous and 
      central locomotor activity or inducing depressive-like behavior on the forced 
      swim test in mice. The other doses of rimonabant also selectively blocked acute 
      ethanol-induced central hyperlocomotion. Although rimonabant at 0.3 and 1mg/kg 
      potentiated the central hyperlocomotion induced by acute morphine injection, it 
      was effective in attenuating morphine-induced behavioral sensitization at all 
      doses. CONCLUSIONS: Because the neural basis of behavioral sensitization has been 
      proposed to correspond to some components of addiction, our findings indicate 
      that the endocannabinoid system might be involved in ethanol, cocaine and 
      morphine abuse.

AB  - The main challenge in treating opioid addicts is to maintain abstinence due to 
      the affective consequences associated with withdrawal which may trigger relapse. 
      Emerging evidence suggests a role of the neurohypophysial peptide oxytocin (OT) 
      in the modulation of mood disorders as well as drug addiction. However, its 
      involvement in the emotional consequences of drug abstinence remains unclear. We 
      investigated the effect of 7-day opioid abstinence on the oxytocinergic system 
      and assessed the effect of the OT analogue carbetocin (CBT) on the emotional 
      consequences of opioid abstinence, as well as relapse. Male C57BL/6J mice were 
      treated with a chronic escalating-dose morphine regimen (20-100 mg/kg/day, i.p.). 
      Seven days withdrawal from this administration paradigm induced a decrease of 
      hypothalamic OT levels and a concomitant increase of oxytocin receptor (OTR) 
      binding in the lateral septum and amygdala. Although no physical withdrawal 
      symptoms or alterations in the plasma corticosterone levels were observed after 7 
      days of abstinence, mice exhibited increased anxiety-like and depressive-like 
      behaviors and impaired sociability. CBT (6.4 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the observed 
      negative emotional consequences of opioid withdrawal. Furthermore, in the 
      conditioned place preference paradigm with 10 mg/kg morphine conditioning, CBT 
      (6.4 mg/kg, i.p.) was able to prevent the stress-induced reinstatement to 
      morphine-seeking following extinction. Overall, our results suggest that 
      alterations of the oxytocinergic system contribute to the mechanisms underlying 
      anxiety, depression, and social deficits observed during opioid abstinence. This 
      study also highlights the oxytocinergic system as a target for developing 
      pharmacotherapy for the treatment of emotional impairment associated with 
      abstinence and thereby prevention of relapse.

AB  - This study questions whether the classical interpretation for unconditional 
      fear/anxiety tests is valid when animals are under the influence of some drugs of 
      abuse. We used a modified version of the trimethylthiazoline (TMT)-avoidance 
      task, a measure of unconditional fear. Halfway into a corridor maze we placed a 
      3-cm-high barrier. This provided a wall in the middle of the corridor, one that 
      the mice can easily climb over. Saline- and morphine-treated mice were randomly 
      placed in the 'safe' or 'unsafe' (TMT) side and observed for 10 min. As expected, 
      saline-injected mice spent only about 25% of the time in the TMT side, regardless 
      of the side they were initially placed into. In contrast, morphine-treated mice 
      did not cross the barrier even once, regardless of their initial placement. 
      Specifically, morphine-treated mice initially placed in the TMT side appeared to 
      exhibit the expected reduction in unconditional fear, that is, spending the 
      entire time in the TMT side, a significant increase over the controls. Yet, 
      morphine-treated mice placed in the safe side never even entered the TMT side; 
      thus, these mice appeared to exhibit a behavioural response that is classically 
      interpreted as increased fear, that is, spending significantly less time in the 
      TMT side versus the controls. In summary, this study demonstrates that the 
      classical interpretation of some unconditioned fear or anxiety tests could be 
      misleading when animals are under the influence of drugs that might induce other 
      competing behaviours.

TI  - Morphine- and foot shock-responsive neuronal ensembles in the VTA possess 
      different connectivity and biased GPCR signaling pathway.
PG  - 1126-1146
LID - 10.7150/thno.90792 [doi]
AB  - Background: Neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are sensitive to stress 
      and their maladaptation have been implicated in the psychiatric disorders such as 
      anxiety and addiction, etc. The cellular properties of the VTA neurons in 
      response to different stressors related to different emotional processing remain 
      to be investigated. Methods: By combining immediate early gene (IEG)-dependent 
      labeling, rabies virus tracing, ensemble-specific transcriptomic analysis and 
      fiber photometry recording in the VTA of male mice, the spatial distribution, 
      brain-wide connectivity and cellular signaling pathways in the VTA neuronal 
      ensembles in response to morphine (Mor-Ens) or foot shock (Shock-Ens) stimuli 
      were investigated. Results: Optogenetic activation of the Mor-Ens drove approach 
      behavior, whereas chemogenetic activation of the Shock-Ens increased the anxiety 
      level in mice. Mor-Ens were clustered and enriched in the ventral VTA, contained 
      a higher proportion of dopaminergic neurons, received more inputs from the dorsal 
      medial striatum and the medial hypothalamic zone, and exhibited greater axonal 
      arborization in the zona incerta and ventral pallidum. Whereas Shock-Ens were 
      more dispersed, contained a higher proportion of GABAergic neurons, and received 
      more inputs from the ventral pallidum and the lateral hypothalamic area. The 
      downstream targets of the G protein and β-arrestin pathways, PLCβ3 and 
      phosphorylated AKT1(Thr308), were relatively enriched in the Mor-Ens and 
      Shock-Ens, respectively. Cariprazine, the G-protein-biased agonist for the 
      dopamine D2 receptor, increased the response of Mor-Ens to sucrose water and 
      decreased the anxiety-like behavior during morphine withdrawal, whereas the 
      β-arrestin-biased agonist UNC9994 decreased the response of Shock-Ens to tail 
      suspension. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings reveal the heterogeneous 
      connectivity and signaling pathways of the VTA neurons in response to morphine 
      and foot shock, providing new insights for development of specific interventions 
      for psychiatric disorders caused by various stressors associated with different 
      VTA neuronal functions.

TI  - Neuropeptide S inhibits the acquisition and the expression of conditioned place 
      preference to morphine in mice.
PG  - 234-40
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.10.004 [doi]
AB  - Neuropeptide S (NPS), a recently identified bioactive peptide, was reported to 
      regulate arousal, anxiety, motoring and feeding behaviors. NPS precursor and NPS 
      receptor mRNA were found in the amygdala, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and 
      the substantia nigra, the area thought to modulate rewarding properties of drugs. 
      In the present study, we examined the influence of NPS on the rewarding action of 
      morphine, using the unbiased conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. 
      Morphine (1, 3 and 6 nmol, i.c.v.) induced a significant place preference. For 
      testing the effect of NPS on the acquisition of morphine CPP, mice were given the 
      combination of NPS and morphine on the conditioning days, and without drug 
      treatment on the followed test day. To study the effect of NPS on the expression 
      of morphine CPP, mice received the treatment of saline/morphine on the 
      conditioning days, and NPS on the test day, 15 min before the placement in the 
      CPP apparatus. Our results showed that NPS (0.3-10 nmol) alone neither induced 
      place preference nor aversion, however, NPS (1 and 3 nmol) blocked the 
      acquisition of CPP induced by 3 nmol morphine, and acquisition of 6 nmol 
      morphine-induced CPP was also reduced by NPS (6 and 10 nmol). Moreover, the 
      expression of CPP induced by 6 nmol morphine was also inhibited by NPS (0.1, 1 
      and 10 nmol). These results revealed the involvement of NPS in rewarding 
      activities of morphine, and demonstrated the interaction between NPS system and 
      opioid system for the first time.

TI  - Divergent behavioral responses in protracted opioid withdrawal in male and female 
      C57BL/6J mice.
PG  - 742-754
LID - 10.1111/ejn.14580 [doi]
AB  - Persons suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD) experience long-lasting 
      dysphoric symptoms well into extended periods of withdrawal. This protracted 
      withdrawal syndrome is notably characterized by heightened anxiety and 
      hyperkatifeia. Here, we investigated if an exacerbated withdrawal model of acute 
      morphine dependence results in lasting behavioral adaptation 6 weeks into forced 
      abstinence in C57BL/6J mice. We found that our exacerbated morphine withdrawal 
      paradigm produced distinct alterations in behavior in elevated plus maze (EPM), 
      open field, and social interaction tests in male and female mice. Following 
      protracted withdrawal male mice showed enhanced exploration of the open arms of 
      the EPM, reduced latency to enter the corner of the OF, and a social interaction 
      deficit. In contrast, female mice showed enhanced thigmotaxis in the OF. In both 
      sexes, protracted withdrawal enhanced locomotor behavior in response to 
      subsequent morphine challenge, albeit at different doses. These findings will be 
      relevant for future investigation examining the neural mechanisms underlying 
      these behaviors and will aid in uncovering physiological sex differences in 
      response to opioid withdrawal.

TI  - Pain-inhibiting inhomogeneous static magnetic field fails to influence locomotor 
      activity and anxiety behavior in mice: no interference between magnetic field- 
      and morphine-treatment.
PG  - 316-21

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We wanted to demonstrate (i) in the writhing test in mice, whether 
      there was a prolonged analgesic effect induced by an inhomogeneous static 
      magnetic field (SMF) exposure; (ii) whether SMF had an effect on the analgesic 
      effect induced by 0.5mg/kgs.c. administered morphine, on the behavioral patterns, 
      and on the hyperlocomotion-inducing effect of morphine. DESIGN: A magnetic 
      exposure system developed by the present authors was used with peak-to-peak flux 
      densities in the 2-754mT range. The writhing test was used for the assessment of 
      pain. An elevated plus maze and a Conducta System was used for studying the 
      anxiogenic or anxyolitic effect in mice, and the locomotor activity, 
      respectively. OUTCOME MEASURES: We looked for the difference in the number of 
      writhings and in the behavioral patterns between treated (s.c. morphine and/or 
      SMF exposure) and control animals, respectively. RESULTS: (i) The antinociceptive 
      effect could be identified 10-30min following SMF exposition in the writhing test 
      in mice. (ii) SMF failed to affect the morphine-induced antinociception, the 
      behavioral patterns in either type of tests, and the hyperlocomotion-inducing 
      effect of morphine. CONCLUSIONS: (i) The long-lasting antinociceptive effect of 
      SMF allows experiments under conditions, when in situ application of the 
      SMF-producing device would be technically difficult or impossible; or where it 
      would disturb the experiments. (ii) The results of behavioral tests with freely 
      moving mice in or in the vicinity of inhomogeneous SMFs are not affected by the 
      SMF in the applied flux density range. (iii) Morphine in treated subjects is not 
      interacting with the inhomogeneous SMFs in the applied flux density range.

      mild morphine withdrawal in mice.

AB  - Obestatin is a 23-amino acid gut-derived neuropeptide, encoded by the same gene 
      with ghrelin. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of obestatin on 
      the acute and chronic analgesic actions of morphine and on mild morphine 
      withdrawal. Open-field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests were used to 
      assess mild morphine withdrawal-induced behavior changes and the heat-radiant 
      tail-flick assay was used to investigate analgesic actions of morphine. CFLP male 
      mice were treated twice a day with graded doses of morphine in EPM and OF 
      experiments and once a day in tail-flick studies. Obestatin (1.5μg/2μl) was 
      administrated once a day in all experiments. Furthermore, 0.2mg/kg naloxone or 
      saline was administered after the final injection of morphine at a dose of 
      20mg/kg in EPM and OF. These behavioral parameters were monitored in the OF: the 
      percentage of center ambulation time and distance; whereas in the EPM: the time 
      spent in open arms and the entries into open arms compared to the total time 
      (%OAT) and entries (%OAE). In the OF, obestatin significantly decreased the 
      percentage of time spent in the center in mice undergoing naloxone-precipitated 
      mild morphine withdrawal. EPM results were similar to open field, but obestatin 
      had no significant effect on parameters mentioned above. Besides, obestatin 
      maintained the analgesic effect of morphine 90 and 120min after morphine 
      injection in mice treated with morphine receiving obestatin compared to mice 
      treated with morphine. In tolerance studies, obestatin diminished the analgesic 
      tolerance to morphine on the 5th day. In this study we confirmed that obestatin 
      reversed the effect of mild morphine withdrawal and enhances the analgesic effect 
      of morphine. These data suggest that obestatin may have a role in opioid-induced 
      analgesia and in behavioral responses induced by opioid withdrawal.

TI  - Specific blockade of morphine- and cocaine-induced reinforcing effects in 
      conditioned place preference by nitrous oxide in mice.
PG  - 477-86
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N(2)O), a pharmacological active gas and an antagonist of 
      N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors, has been reported to be effective in the 
      treatment of alcohol and tobacco withdrawal syndrome. However, the 
      neurobiological bases of N(2)O effects are unknown. The aim of the present 
      studies was to examine the effect of N(2)O on acquisition and expression of 
      morphine- (10 mg/kg; s.c.) and cocaine- (20 mg/kg; i.p.) induced conditioned 
      place preference (CPP) in mice. Unbiased place conditioning method was used. Mice 
      were exposed to N(2)O during the conditioning phase (acquisition of CPP) or 
      during postconditioning phase (expression of CPP). The same protocol was used to 
      evaluate the impact of N(2)O on locomotor activity, two-trial recognition task 
      (memory), spontaneous alternation, sucrose consumption (anhedonic state), forced 
      swim (depressive state) and elevated O-maze tests (anxiety state). In all these 
      tests, mice were treated with morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) the first day, the 
      following day mice were given saline. This sequence alternated during the next 4 
      days. Control animals received saline every day. The behavior of animals was 
      evaluated on day 8. N(2)O did not induce CPP but impaired the acquisition of 
      morphine-induced CPP and blocked the expression of cocaine- and morphine-induced 
      CPP. The effects of the gas were long lasting and persist 4 days following the 
      exposure. Moreover no behavioral modifications in tests usually used to 
      investigated emotional state as compared with control mice were observed in 
      animals exposed to N(2)O, ruling out an effect of this gas on attention, anxiety, 
      depression, locomotion and anhedonia. These studies raise the possibility that 
      N(2)O could have a clinical benefit in the management of morphine and cocaine 
      addiction.

TI  - Neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing neurons in the amygdala modulate morphine reward 
      and anxiety behaviors in the mouse.
PG  - 8271-80
AB  - Mice lacking the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor, the preferred receptor for the 
      neuropeptide substance P (SP), do not show many of the behaviors associated with 
      morphine reward. To identify the areas of the brain that might contribute to this 
      effect, we assessed the behavioral effects of ablation of neurons expressing the 
      NK1 receptor in specific regions of the mouse brain using the neurotoxin 
      substance P-saporin. In a preliminary investigation, bilateral ablation of these 
      neurons from the amygdala, but not the nucleus accumbens and dorsomedial caudate 
      putamen, brought about reductions in morphine reward behavior. Subsequently, the 
      effect of ablation of these neurons in the amygdala on anxiety behavior was 
      assessed using the elevated plus maze (EPM), before conditioned place preference 
      (CPP), and locomotor responses to morphine were measured. Loss of NK1 
      receptor-expressing neurons in the amygdala caused an increase in anxiety-like 
      behavior on the EPM. It also brought about a reduction in morphine CPP scores and 
      the stimulant effect of acute morphine administration relative to saline 
      controls, without affecting CPP to cocaine. NK1 receptor-expressing neurons in 
      the mouse amygdala therefore modulate morphine reward behaviors. These 
      observations mirror those observed in NK1 receptor knock-out (NK1-/-) mice and 
      suggest that the amygdala is an important area for the effects of SP and the NK1 
      receptor in the motivational properties of opiates, as well as the control of 
      behaviors related to anxiety.

TI  - Exploration of mice in a black and white test box: validation as a model of 
      anxiety.
PG  - 777-85
AB  - The validity of a black and white test box to measure changes in mouse 
      exploratory behaviour relevant to assessment of anxiety was investigated by 
      variation of the illumination within the test box, the use of different strains 
      of mice, holding conditions and drug treatments. The suppression of exploratory 
      activity in the white section caused by bright illumination was antagonised by 
      anxiolytic agents from the benzodiazepine series, buspirone, 5-HT3 receptor 
      antagonists, alcohol, nicotine, morphine and SCH23390. The anxiogenic agent 
      FG7142 exacerbated the behavioural suppression. Black C57/BL/6, brown DBA2 and 
      albino BKW mice were sensitive to the effects of drug treatments, whereas albino 
      Tuck mice were less responsive. It is concluded that the characteristic change in 
      mouse exploratory behaviour caused by anxiolytic agents is to preferentially 
      increase exploratory behaviour in the white aversive section of the black and 
      white test box. It is most consistently shown by (a) an increased time spent in 
      the white section with proportional increases in (b) rearings and (c) ambulation 
      and (d) a delay in the initial transition from the white to the black section.

AB  - l-theanine, 2-amino-4-(ethylcarbamoyl) butyric acid, an amino acid found in green 
      tea (Camellia sinensis), is sold in the United States as a dietary supplement to 
      reduce stress and improve cognition and mood. The observations that l-theanine 
      has been shown to inhibit caffeine's stimulatory effects and that caffeine 
      produces precipitated withdrawal signs in opioid-addicted monkeys and some opioid 
      withdrawal signs in some normal monkeys, suggest that l-theanine may suppress 
      opioid withdrawal signs. Additionally, l-theanine produces anxiolytic effects in 
      humans indicating that it has anti-anxiety properties. Thus, in these studies we 
      determined whether l-theanine attenuates opioid-withdrawal signs in 
      morphine-dependent rhesus monkeys, a model for spontaneous opioid withdrawal in 
      human opioid addicts. We also evaluated whether l-theanine decreases anxiety-like 
      behavior in mice, using the elevated plus maze and marble burying assays. 
      l-theanine significantly attenuated designated opioid withdrawal signs, including 
      fighting, rigid abdominal muscles, vocalizing on palpation of abdomen, pacing, 
      retching, wet-dog shakes, and masturbation. It had a relatively quick onset of 
      action that persisted for at least 2.5h. l-theanine also produced anxiolytic-like 
      effects in the elevated plus maze and the marble burying assay in naïve mice at 
      doses that did not significantly affect motor behavior. The results of these 
      studies suggest that l-theanine may be useful in the pharmacotherapy of treating 
      opioid withdrawal as well as anxiety-associated behaviors.

AB  - Novel thiadiazole derivatives bearing hydrazone moieties were synthesized through 
      the reaction of 2-[(5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thio)]acetohydrazide with 
      aldehydes/ketones. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by 
      (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, MS-FAB spectral data, and elemental analyses. Behavioral 
      effects of the test compounds in mice were examined by hole-board, activity cage, 
      tail suspension and modified forced swimming tests (MFST). Antinociceptive 
      activities were evaluated using the hot-plate and tail-clip methods. Results of 
      the experiments indicated that the test compounds did not significantly change 
      the exploratory behaviors or locomotor activities of animals in the hole-board 
      and activity cage tests, respectively. Administration of the reference drug 
      fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and compounds 3a, 3b, 3c, 3j, 3k, and 3l significantly 
      shortened the immobility times of animals in the tail suspension and MFST tests, 
      indicating the antidepressant-like effects of these derivatives. Morphine (10 
      mg/kg) and compounds 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3j, 3k, and 3l increased the reaction 
      times of mice in both the hot-plate and tail-clip tests, indicating the 
      antinociceptive effects of these compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
      the first study of central nervous system activities of chemical compounds 
      carrying thiadiazole and hydrazone moieties together on their structures.

TI  - Wnt7a in Mouse Insular Cortex Contributes to Anxiety-like Behavior During

AB  - Anxiety is considered an important protracted abstinence symptom that can 
      aggravate craving and relapse risk in opioid addicts. Although the insular cortex 
      (IC) has been reported to be a key brain region in mediating emotional and 
      motivational alterations induced by drug consumption and withdrawal, the role of 
      IC in anxiety related to protracted abstinence remains elusive. In this study, we 
      found that: (1) anxiety-like behavior in morphine-dependent mice became 
      significant after 28 days of withdrawal, while their physical symptoms became 
      undetectable. (2) Activated glutamatergic neurons in the medial IC, but not the 
      anterior or posterior IC were significantly increased after 28 days of 
      withdrawal. Bilateral lesion of the medial IC, but not the anterior or posterior 
      IC with ibotenic acid (IBO) alleviated the anxiety-like behavior. (3) Expression 
      of Wnt7a in the medial IC was significantly increased after 28 days of 
      withdrawal, and specific down-regulation of Wnt7a with AAV-shWnt7a also 
      alleviated the anxiety-like behavior. The findings reveal the medial IC is 
      involved in mediating anxiety-like behavior related to morphine protracted 
      abstinence, in which Wnt7a plays a critical role.

AB  - The majority of HIV(+) patients present with neuroendocrine dysfunction and ~50% 
      experience co-morbid neurological symptoms including motor, affective, and 
      cognitive dysfunction, collectively termed neuroHIV. In preclinical models, the 
      neurotoxic HIV-1 regulatory protein, trans-activator of transcription (Tat), 
      promotes neuroHIV pathology that can be exacerbated by opioids. We and others 
      find gonadal steroids, estradiol (E(2)) or progesterone (P(4)), to rescue 
      Tat-mediated pathology. However, the combined effects of Tat and opioids on 
      neuroendocrine function and the subsequent ameliorative capacity of gonadal 
      steroids are unknown. We found that conditional HIV-1 Tat expression in 
      naturally-cycling transgenic mice dose-dependently potentiated oxycodone-mediated 
      psychomotor behavior. Tat increased depression-like behavior in a tail-suspension 
      test among proestrous mice, but decreased it among diestrous mice (who already 
      demonstrated greater depression-like behavior); oxycodone reversed these effects. 
      Combined Tat and oxycodone produced apparent behavioral disinhibition of 
      anxiety-like responding which was greater on diestrus than on proestrus. These 
      mice made more central entries in an open field, but spent less time there and 
      demonstrated greater circulating corticosterone. Tat increased the E(2):P(4) 
      ratio of circulating steroids on diestrus and acute oxycodone attenuated this 
      effect, but repeated oxycodone exacerbated it. Corticotropin-releasing factor was 
      increased by Tat expression, acute oxycodone exposure, and was greater on 
      diestrus compared to proestrus. In human neuroblastoma cells, Tat exerted 
      neurotoxicity that was ameliorated by E(2) (1 or 10 nM) or P(4) (100, but not 
      10 nM) independent of oxycodone. Oxycodone decreased gene expression of estrogen 
      and κ-opioid receptors. Thus, neuroendocrine function may be an important target 
      for HIV-1 Tat/opioid interactions.

AB  - Opiates, one of the oldest known drugs, are the benchmark for treating pain. 
      Regular opioid exposure also induces euphoria making these compounds addictive 
      and often misused, as shown by the current epidemic of opioid abuse and overdose 
      mortalities. In addition to the effect of opioids on their cognate receptors and 
      signaling cascades, these compounds also induce multiple adaptations at cellular 
      and behavioral levels. As omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) play a 
      ubiquitous role in behavioral and cellular processes, we proposed that 
      supplemental n-3 PUFAs, enriched in docosahexanoic acid (DHA), could offset these 
      adaptations following chronic opioid exposure. We used an 8 week regimen of n-3 
      PUFA supplementation followed by 8 days of morphine in the presence of this diet. 
      We first assessed the effect of morphine in different behavioral measures and 
      found that morphine increased anxiety and reduced wheel-running behavior. These 
      effects were reduced by dietary n-3 PUFAs without affecting morphine-induced 
      analgesia or hyperlocomotion, known effects of this opiate acting at mu opioid 
      receptors. At the cellular level we found that morphine reduced striatal DHA 
      content and that this was reversed by supplemental n-3 PUFAs. Chronic morphine 
      also increased glutamatergic plasticity and the proportion of Grin2B-NMDARs in 
      striatal projection neurons. This effect was similarly reversed by supplemental 
      n-3 PUFAs. Gene analysis showed that supplemental PUFAs offset the effect of 
      morphine on genes found in neurons of the dopamine receptor 2 (D2)-enriched 
      indirect pathway but not of genes found in dopamine receptor 1(D1)-enriched 
      direct-pathway neurons. Analysis of the D2 striatal connectome by a retrogradely 
      transported pseudorabies virus showed that n-3 PUFA supplementation reversed the

AB  - Gelsemium, a small genus of flowering plant from the family Loganiaceae, 
      comprises five species including the popular Gelsemium sempervirens Ait. and 
      Gelsemium elegans Benth., which are indigenous to North America and China/East 
      Asia, respectively. Approximately 120 alkaloids have been isolated and identified 
      from Gelsemium, with the predominant indole alkaloids including gelsemine, 
      koumine, gelsemicine, gelsenicine, gelsedine, sempervirine, koumidine, koumicine 
      and humantenine. Gelsemine is the principal active alkaloid in G. sempervirens 
      Ait., and koumine and gelsemine are the most and second-most dominant alkaloids 
      in G. elegans Benth. Gelsemium extract and its active alkaloids serve a variety 
      of biological functions, including neurobiological, immunosuppressive and 
      antitumor effects, and have traditionally been used to treat pain, neuralgia, 
      anxiety, insomnia, asthma, respiratory ailments and cancers. This review focuses 
      on animal-based studies of Gelsemium as a pain treatment and its mechanism of 
      action. In contrast to morphine, when administered intrathecally and 
      systemically, koumine, gelsemine and gelsenicine have marked antinociception in 
      inflammatory, neuropathic and bone cancer pains without inducing antinociceptive 
      tolerance. Gelsemium and its active alkaloids may produce antinociception by 
      activating the spinal α3 glycine/allopregnanolone pathway. The results of this 
      review support the clinical use of Gelsemium and suggest that its active 
      alkaloids may be developed to treat intractable and other types of pain, 
      preferably after chemical modification. However, Gelsemium is a known toxic 
      plant, and its toxicity limits its appropriate dosage and clinical use. To avoid 
      or decrease the side/toxic effects of Gelsemium, an individual monomer of highly 
      potent alkaloids must be selected, or alkaloids that exhibit greater α3 glycine 
      receptor selectivity may be discovered or modified.

TI  - Regional mRNA expression of GABAergic receptor subunits in brains of C57BL/6J and 
      129P3/J mice: strain and heroin effects.
PG  - 49-58
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2013.05.040 [doi]
AB  - C57BL/6J and 129 substrains of mice are known to differ in their basal levels of 
      anxiety and behavioral response to drugs of abuse. We have previously shown 
      strain differences in heroin-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) between 
      C57BL/6J (C57) and 129P3/J (129) mice, and in the regional expression of several 
      receptor and peptide mRNAs. In this study, we examined the contribution of the 
      GABAergic system in the cortex, nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu) 
      and the region containing the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area 
      (SN/VTA) to heroin reward by measuring mRNA levels of 7 of the most commonly 
      expressed GABA-A receptor subunits, and both GABA-B receptor subunits, in these 
      same mice following saline (control) or heroin administration in a CPP design. 
      Using real-time PCR, we studied the effects of strain and heroin administration 
      on GABA-A α1, α2, α3, β2, and γ2 subunits, which typically constitute synaptic 
      GABA-A receptors, GABA-A α4 and δ subunits, which typically constitute 
      extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors, and GABA-B R1 and R2 subunits. In saline-treated 
      animals, we found an experiment-wise significant strain difference in GABA-Aα2 
      mRNA expression in the SN/VTA. Point-wise significant strain differences were 
      also observed in GABA-Aα2, GABA-Aα3, and GABA-Aα4 mRNA expression in the NAc, as 
      well as GABA-BR2 mRNA expression in the NAc and CPu, and GABA-BR1 mRNA expression 
      in the cortex. For all differences, 129 mice had higher mRNA expression compared 
      to C57 animals, with the exception of GABA-BR1 mRNA in the cortex where we 
      observed lower levels in 129 mice. Therefore, it may be possible that known 
      behavioral differences between these two strains are, in part, due to differences 
      in their GABAergic systems. While we did not find heroin dose-related changes in 
      mRNA expression levels in C57 mice, we did observe dose-related differences in 
      129 mice. These results may relate to our earlier behavioral finding that 129 
      mice are hyporesponsive to the rewarding effects of heroin.

TI  - Morphine protects for head trauma induced cognitive deficits in mice.
PG  - 239-42
AB  - Victims of minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can show long lasting cognitive, 
      emotional and concentration difficulties, amnesia, depression, apathy and 
      anxiety. The symptoms are generally known as a post-concussive syndrome without 
      clear morphological brain defects. Endogenous opiates are released after impact 
      to the brain, suggesting they may play a role in TBI pathophysiology. 
      Furthermore, the administration of opiates to the brain of injured animals has 
      been shown to affect the injury, induce cellular changes and also have protective 
      qualities for neurological impairments. Here, we examined the protective 
      properties of the opiate morphine on cognitive performances following minimal 
      brain injury in mice. For this purpose, we have used our non-invasive closed-head 
      weight drop model in mice, which closely mimics real life mTBI and examined mice 
      performance in the Morris water maze. Our procedure did not cause visible 
      structural or neurological damage to the mice. A single morphine injection 
      administrated immediately after the induction of minimal TBI protected the 
      injured mice from cognitive impairment, checked 30, 60 and 90 days post injury. 
      However, mice injected with morphine that were examined 7 days after the injury 
      did not show better performance than the saline injected mice. Our results 
      indicate that morphine has long but not short-term effects on the cognitive 
      ability of brain-injured mice. Although the exact nature of opioid 
      neuroprotection is still unknown, its elucidation may lead to the much-needed 
      treatment for traumatic brain injury.

AB  - A crucial issue in treating opiate addiction, a chronic relapsing disorder, is to 
      maintain a drug-free abstinent state. Prolonged abstinence associates with mood 
      disorders, strongly contributing to relapse. In particular, substance use 
      disorders occurring during adolescence predispose to depression later in 
      adulthood. Using our established mouse model of opiate abstinence, we 
      characterized emotional consequences into adulthood of morphine exposure during 
      adolescence. Our results indicate that morphine treatment in adolescent mice has 
      no effect on anxiety-like behaviours in adult mice, after abstinence. In 
      contrast, morphine treatment during adolescence increases behavioural despair in 
      adult mice. We also show that morphine exposure strain-dependently enhances 
      sociability in adult mice. Additional research will be required to understand 
      where and how morphine acts during brain maturation to affect emotional and 
      social behaviours into adulthood.

TI  - Effects of buprenorphine on behavioral tests for antidepressant and anxiolytic 
      drugs in mice.
PG  - 907-15

AB  - RATIONALE: Buprenorphine (BPN) has been shown to rapidly improve mood in 
      treatment-resistant depressed patients in small clinical studies. However, BPN's 
      effects in preclinical tests for mood and antidepressant efficacy are largely 
      unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the effects of BPN in the 
      forced swim test (FST) and novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test as measures of 
      antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects in C57BL/6 J mice. Microdialysis was 
      used to measure whether BPN engaged kappa-opioid receptor (KORs) in the nucleus 
      accumbens shell (NAcSh) at a behaviorally active dose (0.25 mg/kg). METHODS: BPN 
      was tested in the FST at both 30 min and 24 h post-administration. Also measured 
      in the FST at 24 h post-administration were the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine 
      (nor-BNI), the MOR agonist morphine and the reference antidepressant desipramine. 
      The anxiolytic effects of BPN were examined in the NIH test 24 h after treatment. 
      The effects of acute injection of BPN and the KOR agonist U50,488 were measured 
      on extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the NAcSh. RESULTS: BPN produced 
      significant reductions in FST immobility without changing locomotor activity and 
      reduced approach latencies in the novel environment of the NIH test when tested 
      24 h after treatment. Repeated daily BPN injections for 6 days did not produce 
      tolerance to these behavioral effects. nor-BNI produced a similar 
      antidepressant-like response in the FST 24 h post-injection but morphine and 
      desipramine were ineffective. BPN (0.25 mg/kg) did not alter DA levels when given 
      alone but prevented the KOR agonist U50,488 from reducing DA levels. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Acute and subchronic treatment with BPN produced antidepressant and 
      anxiolytic-like responses in mice at doses that engage KORs. These studies 
      support the clinical evidence that BPN may be a novel rapid-acting antidepressant 
      medication and provides rodent models for investigating associated neurochemical 
      mechanisms.

TI  - Increase of morphine withdrawal in mice lacking A2a receptors and no changes in 
      CB1/A2a double knockout mice.
PG  - 315-24
AB  - CB1 cannabinoid and A2a adenosine receptors are highly expressed in the central 
      nervous system where they modulate numerous physiological processes including 
      emotional behaviour and the responses of several drugs of abuse. To investigate 
      the contribution of these receptors in emotional-like responses and opioid 
      dependence we have generated CB1/A2a double deficient mice (CB1-/-/A2a-/-). The 
      spontaneous locomotor activity was reduced in double knockout as compared to 
      wild-type animals. Emotional-like responses of CB1-/-/A2a-/- mice were 
      investigated using the elevated plus-maze and the lit-dark box. Mutant mice 
      exhibited an increased level of anxiety in both behavioural models. The specific 
      involvement of CB1 and A2a receptors in morphine dependence was evaluated by 
      using A2a knockout mice and CB1/A2a double mutant mice. The severity of 
      naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal syndrome was significantly increased in 
      the absence of A2a adenosine receptors whereas no modifications were observed in 
      the double knockout mice. These results suggest that both receptors participate 
      in the control of emotional behaviour and seem to play an opposite role in the 
      expression of opioid physical dependence.

TI  - Morphine-induced macrophage apoptosis: oxidative stress and strategies for 
      modulation.
PG  - 1131-8
AB  - Occurrence of macrophage apoptosis has been implicated for the altered immune 
      function found in an opiate milieu. In the present study, we evaluated the role 
      of oxidative stress in morphine-induced macrophage apoptosis. Morphine promoted 
      the apoptosis of macrophages. This effect of morphine was associated with the 
      production of superoxide and nitric oxide (NO). Antioxidants provided protection 
      against morphine-induced macrophage injury. In addition, diphenyleneiodonium 
      chloride, an inhibitor of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
      (NADPH) oxidase activation, attenuated the proapoptotic effect of morphine. 
      Antitransforming growth factor-beta (anti-TGF-beta) antibody and propranolol (an 
      inhibitor of the phospholipase D pathway) inhibited morphine-induced superoxide 
      generation as well as apoptosis. N'-Tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester, 
      a calcium-chelating agent, inhibited morphine-induced apoptosis, whereas 
      thapsigargin (a calcium agonist) stimulated macrophage apoptosis under basal as 
      well as morphine-stimulated states. These studies suggest that morphine-induced 
      macrophage apoptosis is mediated through downstream signaling involving TGF-beta 
      and NO production. Moreover, there is NADPH oxidation activation involving 
      phospholipase D and Ca(2+), leading to the generation of superoxide. In in vivo 
      studies, administration of N-acetyl cysteine and preinduction of heme oxygenase 
      activity and epoetin alpha prevented morphine-induced peritoneal macrophage 
      apoptosis, thus further confirming the role of oxidative stress in 
      morphine-induced macrophage apoptosis.

TI  - Response to opioids is dependent on sociability levels.
PG  - 293-307
LID - 10.1097/FBP.0000000000000552 [doi]
AB  - Social environment influences the trajectory of developing opioid use disorder 
      (OUD). Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that sociability levels will 
      affect the responses to opioids. Mice were tested for their baseline sociability, 
      anxiety levels, pain sensitivities, and their acute locomotor response to 5 mg/kg 
      opioids. Then, they were administered repeatedly with saline, hydrocodone, or 
      morphine (20 mg/kg for 5 days, and then 40 mg/kg for 5 days). Subsequently, they 
      were examined for the expression of locomotor sensitization and retested for the 
      effects of opioids on their sociability, anxiety levels, and pain sensitivity. On 
      the basis of their baseline sociability level, mice were divided into socially 
      avoiding and socially exploring. Socially avoiding and socially exploring mice 
      did not differ in their baseline weight and anxiety sensitivities. Socially 
      avoiding mice had slightly higher baseline heat sensitivity than those in 
      socially exploring mice. Repeated administration of opioids had differential 
      effects in socially avoiding and socially exploring mice. In both social groups, 
      repeated morphine administration had overall stronger effects compared with 
      hydrocodone. Morphine-treated socially exploring mice developed greater locomotor 
      sensitization than those in morphine-treated socially avoiding mice. 
      Morphine-treated socially avoiding mice, but not socially exploring mice, spent 
      more time in the center zone of the open-field test and in the light zone of 
      light/dark boxes, and developed heat hyperalgesia. This study suggests that 
      socially exploring animals are more sensitive to the sensitizing effects of 
      opioids. In contrast, opioids have greater effects on the stress and pain systems 
      of socially avoiding animals. Thus, the underlying mechanisms for developing OUD 
      might differ in individuals with various sociability levels.

TI  - Anterior cingulate cortex is necessary for spontaneous opioid withdrawal and 
      withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in male mice.
PG  - 1990-1999
LID - 10.1038/s41386-021-01118-y [doi]
AB  - The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in many pathologies, including 
      depression, anxiety, substance-use disorders, and pain. There is also evidence 
      from brain imaging that the ACC is hyperactive during periods of opioid 
      withdrawal. However, there are limited data contributing to our understanding of 
      ACC function at the cellular level during opioid withdrawal. Here, we address 
      this issue by performing ex vivo electrophysiological analysis of thick-tufted, 
      putative dopamine D2 receptor expressing, layer V pyramidal neurons in the ACC 
      (ACC L5 PyNs) in a mouse model of spontaneous opioid withdrawal. We found that 
      escalating doses of morphine (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/kg, i.p. on days 1-5, 
      respectively) injected twice daily into male C57BL/6 mice evoked withdrawal 
      behaviors and an associated withdrawal-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Brain 
      slices prepared 24 h following the last morphine injection showed increases in 
      ACC L5 thick-tufted PyN-intrinsic membrane excitability, increases in membrane 
      resistance, reductions in the rheobase, and reductions in HCN channel-mediated 
      currents (I(H)). We did not observe changes in intrinsic or synaptic properties 
      on thin-tufted, dopamine D1-receptor-expressing ACC L5 PyNs recorded from male 
      Drd1a-tdTomato transgenic mice. In addition, we found that chemogenetic 
      inhibition of the ACC blocked opioid-induced withdrawal and withdrawal-induced 
      mechanical hypersensitivity. These results demonstrate that spontaneous opioid 
      withdrawal alters neuronal properties within the ACC and that ACC activity is 
      necessary to control behaviors associated with opioid withdrawal and 
      withdrawal-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. The ability of the ACC to 
      regulate both withdrawal behaviors and withdrawal-induced mechanical 
      hypersensitivity suggests overlapping mechanisms between two seemingly 
      distinguishable behaviors. This commonality potentially suggests that the ACC is 
      a locus for multiple withdrawal symptoms.

      Morphine Abstinence: Implications of an mGlu5-MOPr Interaction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A difficult problem in treating opioid addicts is the maintenance of 
      a drug-free state because of the negative emotional symptoms associated with 
      withdrawal, which may trigger relapse. Several lines of evidence suggest a role 
      for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in opioid addiction; however, its 
      involvement during opioid withdrawal is not clear. METHODS: Mice were treated 
      with a 7-day escalating-dose morphine administration paradigm. Following 
      withdrawal, the development of affective behaviors was assessed using the 
      3-chambered box, open-field, elevated plus-maze and forced-swim tests. 
      Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 autoradiographic binding was performed in mouse 
      brains undergoing chronic morphine treatment and 7 days withdrawal. Moreover, 
      since there is evidence showing direct effects of opioid drugs on the 
      metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 system, the presence of an metabotropic 
      glutamate receptor 5/μ-opioid receptor interaction was assessed by performing 
      metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 autoradiographic binding in brains of mice 
      lacking the μ-opioid receptor gene. RESULTS: Withdrawal from chronic morphine 
      administration induced anxiety-like, depressive-like, and impaired sociability 
      behaviors concomitant with a marked upregulation of metabotropic glutamate 
      receptor 5 binding. Administration of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 
      antagonist, 3-((2-Methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl)pyridine, reversed morphine 
      abstinence-induced depressive-like behaviors. A brain region-specific increase in 
      metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 binding was observed in the nucleus accumbens 
      shell, thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala of μ-opioid receptor knockout mice 
      compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an association between 
      metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 alterations and the emergence of opioid 
      withdrawal-related affective behaviors. This study supports metabotropic 
      glutamate receptor 5 system as a target for the development of pharmacotherapies 
      for the treatment of opioid addiction. Moreover, our data show direct effects of 
      μ-opioid receptor system manipulation on metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 
      binding in the brain.

TI  - Long-lasting effects of adolescent oxycodone exposure on reward-related behavior 
      and gene expression in mice.
PG  - 3991-4002
AB  - RATIONALE: Prescription opioid abuse and transition to heroin use are growing 
      problems in the USA. However, the long-term consequences of adolescent 
      prescription opioid abuse on subsequent drug use and affective-like behavior are 
      unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine if adolescent exposure to 
      oxycodone alters the rewarding effects of morphine, anxiety-like behavior, and 
      reward-related gene expression later in adulthood. METHODS: Adolescent male 
      C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to oxycodone (3 mg/kg/day) via osmotic minipumps for 
      28 days. Following a 28-day withdrawal period, mice were tested in 
      morphine-conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP), morphine sensitization, 
      open field, marble burying, and forced swim (FST) tests. To determine if effects 
      were specific to adolescent exposure, adult mice were exposed to oxycodone for 
      28 days and underwent 28 days of withdrawal prior to the same behavioral testing 
      schedule. Expression of reward-related genes including dopamine receptor 1 (D1) 
      and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral 
      tegmental area (VTA) was examined. RESULTS: Adolescent oxycodone exposure 
      significantly increased (300 %) response to morphine CPP during adulthood and 
      significantly reduced D1 expression (30 %) in the NAc and DAT expression (75 %) 
      in the VTA. Adult oxycodone exposure did not affect subsequent responses to 
      morphine CPP. Oxycodone exposure did not affect the development of morphine 
      sensitization or affective-like behaviors. Corticosterone response to a stressor 
      (FST) was significantly reduced (65 %) in mice exposed to oxycodone during 
      adolescence but not adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent oxycodone exposure 
      enhances rewarding effects of morphine in adulthood with no effect on other 
      affective-like behaviors.

TI  - Neuropharmacological and physiological validation of a computer-controlled 
      two-compartment black and white box for the assessment of anxiety.
PG  - 963-76
AB  - 1. The two-compartment black and white box first described by Crawley and Goodwin 
      (1980) has been used to study anti-anxiety properties of drugs but has not been 
      validated. 2. An automated test system and validation of the protocol for the 
      evaluation of compounds with anxiolytic or anxiogenic potential is described. 3. 
      The box is partitioned into black and white sections with an interconnecting 
      opening and is equipped with micro-switch photoelectric controls (light source 
      and photoreceiver) and an interface connected to the menu-driven computer during 
      anxiety testing. 4. Plasma corticosterone levels in naive mice maintained on a 
      reversed L:D cycle was significantly reduced following restricted exposure to the 
      brightly lit white section but not in the red-illuminated black section. 5. The 
      optimal structural configuration in different test situations was found to be a 
      square rather than a round box. 6. Under normal conditions, mice spend about 60% 
      of the time in the dark compartment so that the exploratory activities and time 
      spent in the white section are taken as a measure of anxiety. 7. Compounds 
      examined included the reference anxiolytic diazepam, nicotine, naloxone, MDL 
      72222, ICS 205 930 and buspirone, all of which increased mouse exploratory 
      activities in the white section. PTZ, beta-CCP, morphine and amphetamine 
      increased exploration in the black compartment and reduced exploration in the 
      white area. 8. Fluphenazine and imipramine had no specific effects on anxiety 
      responding, although the cataleptogenic effect of fluphenazine was apparent. 9. 
      Daily repeated testing was possible with a maximum of up to four trials a week 
      using naive animals during the 5-min test session. 10. The results suggest that 
      the rapid and automated test system for the assessment of changes in measures of 
      anxiety is not only valid for large scale evaluation of compounds but could be 
      used to elucidate mechanisms of drug action and the CNS pathways linked with 
      anxiolysis and/or anxiogenesis.

AB  - Morphine, the main component of opium, is a commonly used analgesic in clinical 
      practice, but its abuse potential limits its clinical application. Nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the mesolimbic circuitry play an important 
      role in the rewarding effects of abused drugs. Previous studies have showed that 
      α6β2* (* designated other subunits) nAChRs are mainly distributed in dopaminergic 
      neurons in the midbrain area, which regulates the release of dopamine. So α6β2* 
      nAChRs are regarded as a new target to treat drug abuse. α-Conotoxin TxIB was 
      discovered in our lab, which is the most selective ligand to inhibit α6β2* nAChRs 
      only. Antagonists of α6β2* nAChRs decreased nicotine, cocaine, and ethanol 
      rewarding effects previously. However, their role in morphine addiction has not 
      been reported so far. Thus, it is worth evaluating the effect of α-conotoxin TxIB 
      on the morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and its behavioral 
      changes in mice. Our results showed that TxIB inhibited expression and 
      acquisition of morphine-induced CPP and did not produce a rewarding effect by 
      itself. Moreover, repeated injections of TxIB have no effect on learning, memory, 
      locomotor activity, and anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, blocking α6/α3β2β3 
      nAChRs inhibits the development of morphine-induced CPP. α-Conotoxin TxIB may be 
      a potentially useful compound to mitigate the acquisition and/or retention of 
      drug-context associations.

TI  - Rational Basis for the Use of Bergamot Essential Oil in Complementary Medicine to 
      Treat Chronic Pain.
PG  - 721-8
AB  - In complementary medicine, aromatherapy uses essential oils to improve agitation 
      and aggression observed in dementia, mood, depression, anxiety and chronic pain. 
      Preclinical research studies have reported that the essential oil obtained from 
      bergamot (BEO) fruit (Citrus bergamia, Risso) modifies normal and pathological 
      synaptic plasticity implicated, for instance, in nociceptive and neuropathic 
      pain. Interestingly, recent results indicated that BEO modulates sensitive 
      perception of pain in different models of nociceptive, inflammatory and 
      neuropathic pain modulating endogenous systems. Thus, local administration of BEO 
      inhibited the nociceptive behavioral effect induced by intraplantar injection of 
      capsaicin or formalin in mice. Similar effects were observed with linalool and 
      linalyl acetate, major volatile components of the phytocomplex, Pharmacological 
      studies showed that the latter effects are reversed by local or systemic 
      pretreatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride alike with 
      naloxone methiodide, high affinity peripheral μ-opioid receptor antagonist. These 
      results and the synergistic effect observed following systemic or intrathecal 
      injection of an inactive dose of morphine with BEO or linalool indicated an 
      activation of peripheral opioid system. Recently, in neuropathic pain models 
      systemic or local administration of BEO or linalool induced antiallodynic 
      effects. In particular, in partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) model, 
      intraplantar injection of the phytocomplex or linalool in the ipsilateral 
      hindpaw, but not in the contralateral, reduced PSNL-induced extracellularsignal- 
      regulated kinase (ERK) activation and mechanical allodynia. In neuropathic pain 
      high doses of morphine are needed to reduce pain. Interestingly, combination of 
      inactive doses of BEO or linalool with a low dose of morphine induced 
      antiallodynic effects in mice. Peripheral cannabinoid and opioid systems appear 
      to be involved in the antinociception produced by intraplantar injection of β 
      -caryophyllene, present in different essential oils including BEO. The data 
      gathered so far indicate that the essential oil of bergamot is endowed with 
      antinociceptive and antiallodynic effects and contribute to form the rational 
      basis for rigorous testing of its efficacy in complementary medicine.

AB  - Psychoactive substances during pregnancy and lactation is a key problem in 
      contemporary society, causing social, economic, and health disturbance. In 2010, 
      about 30 million people used opioid analgesics for non-therapeutic purposes, and 
      the prevalence of opioids use during pregnancy ranged from 1% to 21%, 
      representing a public health problem. This study aimed to evaluate the 
      long-lasting neurobehavioral and nociceptive consequences in adult offspring rats 
      and mice exposed to morphine during intrauterine/lactation periods. Pregnant rats 
      and mice were exposed subcutaneously to morphine (10 mg/kg/day) during 42 
      consecutive days (from the first day of pregnancy until the last day of 
      lactation). Offspring were weighed on post-natal days (PND) 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 
      and 60, and behavioral tasks (experiment 1) or nociceptive responses (experiment 
      2) were assessed at 75 days of age (adult life). Morphine-exposed female rats 
      displayed increased spontaneous locomotor activity. More importantly, both males 
      and female rats perinatally exposed to morphine displayed anxiety- and 
      depressive-like behaviors. Morphine-exposed mice presented alterations in the 
      nociceptive responses on the writhing test. This study showed that sex difference 
      plays a role in pain threshold and that deleterious effects of morphine during 
      pre/perinatal periods are nonrepairable in adulthood, which highlights the 
      long-lasting clinical consequences related to anxiety, depression, and 
      nociceptive disorders in adulthood followed by intrauterine and lactation 
      morphine exposure.

TI  - The interaction of morphine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic systems in 
      anxiolytic behavior: using mu-opioid receptor knockout mice.
PG  - 689-94
AB  - We investigated the interaction of morphine and gamma-aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA)ergic systems in anxiolytic action using mu-opioid receptor knockout and 
      wild-type female mice. An elevated plus-maze test was used to assess anxiolytic 
      behavior. The anxiolytic activities were monitored after experimental animals 
      were pretreated with morphine [15 mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.)] and 3 h later 
      received a single dose of muscimol (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). In another experiment, mice 
      received a single dose of opioid antagonist, naloxone [1.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal 
      (i.p.)], or GABA(A) receptor antagonist, (+)bicucullin (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.), 2.5 h 
      after the morphine and 30 min before the muscimol injection. Control mice 
      received vehicle only. The results show that morphine enhanced muscimol-induced 
      staying time in open arms by 160% in wild-type mice. Moreover, the effect of 
      morphine in the wild type was inhibited by the pretreatment of either naloxone or 
      (+)bicucullin. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that morphine-administration 
      raised [(3)H]muscimol binding by around 25% of the basal level in posterior 
      thalamic, mediodorsal thalamic, and amygdaloid areas, but not in the hippocampal 
      area in wild-type mice. In contrast, morphine administration did not alter the 
      [(3)H]muscimol binding in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice. The present results 
      reveal that mu-opioid receptor may play a role in the modification of anxiolytic 
      behavior regulated by GABAergic neurotransmission.

AB  - There is high comorbidity between stress-related psychiatric disorders and 
      addiction, suggesting they may share one or more common neurobiological 
      mechanisms. Because of its role in both depressive and addictive behaviors, the 
      galanin system is a strong candidate for such a mechanism. In this study, we 
      tested if galanin and its receptors are involved in stress-associated behaviors 
      and drug addiction. Mice were exposed to 21 days of chronic restraint stress 
      (CRS); subsequently, mRNA levels of galanin, galanin receptors (GalRs), the 
      rate-limiting enzymes for the synthesis of monoamines, and monoamine 
      autoreceptors were measured in the nucleus accumbens by a quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, we tested the effects of this stress on 
      morphine-induced addictive behaviors. We found that CRS induced anxiety and 
      depression-like behaviors, impaired the formation and facilitated the extinction 
      process in morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), and also blocked 
      morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. These behavioral results were 
      accompanied by a CRS-dependent increase in the mRNA expression of galanin, GalR1, 
      tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan hydroxylase 2, and 5-HT1B receptor. 
      Interestingly, treatment with a commonly used antidepressant, fluoxetine, 
      normalized the CRS-induced behavioral changes based on reversing the higher 
      expression of galanin and TH while increasing the expression of GalR2 and 
      α2A-adrenceptor. These results indicate that activating the galanin system, with 
      corresponding changes to noradrenergic systems, following chronic stress may 
      modulate stress-associated behaviors and opiate addiction. Our findings suggest 
      that galanin and GalRs are worthy of further exploration as potential therapeutic 
      targets to treat stress-related disorders and drug addiction.

AB  - Opioid withdrawal is known to be anxiogenic in humans and, using the elevated 
      plus maze (EPM), was demonstrated to also be anxiogenic in rats. Thus, this study 
      characterizes EPM behaviors of mice during naloxone-precipitated morphine 
      withdrawal. Naloxone did not significantly change EPM behaviors of drug-naïve 
      mice. Additionally, morphine-dependent mice in which withdrawal was not 
      precipitated (i.e. morphine-dependent mice receiving saline) spent less time in 
      the open-arms compared to the controls. Surprisingly, increased open-arm time was 
      observed in morphine-dependent mice undergoing naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. 
      This increase was not because of total motor activity, as no significant 
      differences in total activity were observed. Moreover, morphine dependency was 
      necessary, given that there was not a significant increase in open-arm time for 
      mice undergoing withdrawal from acute morphine. Increased open-arm time during 
      withdrawal is unexpected, given that opioid withdrawal is usually associated with 
      anxiety. Additionally, even in mice, naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal is 
      known be aversive and increases plasma corticosterone levels. In conclusion, this 
      study demonstrates somewhat unexpected EPM behavior in mice undergoing 
      naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Possible interpretations of these EPM 
      results, though somewhat speculative, raise the possibility that EPM behaviors 
      might not be driven exclusively by anxiety levels but rather by other 
      withdrawal-induced behaviors.

AB  - Migraine is a highly prevalent, disabling and complex episodic brain disorder 
      whose pathogenesis is poorly understood, due in part to the lack of valid animal 
      models. Here we report behavioral evidence of hallmark migraine features, 
      photophobia and unilateral head pain, in transgenic knock-in mice bearing human 
      familial hemiplegic migraine, type 1 (FHM-1) gain-of-function missense mutations 
      (R192Q or S218L) in the Cacna1a gene encoding the CaV2.1 calcium channel α1 
      subunit. Photophobia was demonstrated using a modified elevated plus maze in 
      which the safe closed arms were brightly illuminated; mutant mice avoided the 
      light despite showing no differences in the standard (anxiety) version of the 
      test. Multiple behavioral measures suggestive of spontaneous head pain were found 
      in 192Q mutants subjected to novelty and/or restraint stress. These behaviors 
      were: (1) more frequent in mutant versus wildtype mice; (2) lateralized in mutant 
      but not in wildtype mice; (3) more frequent in females versus males; and (4) 
      dose-dependently normalized by systemic administration of 2 different acute 
      analgesics, rizatriptan and morphine. Furthermore, some of these behaviors were 
      found to be more frequent and severe in 218L compared to 192Q mutants, consistent 
      with the clinical presentation in humans. We suggest that Cacna1a transgenic mice 
      can experience migraine-related head pain and can thus serve as unique tools to 
      study the pathogenesis of migraine and test novel antimigraine agents.

TI  - Modulation of anxiety by mu-opioid receptors of the lateral septal region in 
      mice.
PG  - 465-79
AB  - Morphine and opiates are known to exert anxiolytic effects, probably by 
      interacting with the GABAergic system. The lateral septum (LS), mainly 
      constituted of GABA neurons, exhibits high densities of mu-opiate receptors and 
      could thus represent one the brain sites where opiates interact with GABAergic 
      transmission to modulate anxiety. We examined the effects of intra-LS morphine 
      injections on measures of anxiety using the elevated plus-maze and hole-board 
      tests. Fos imaging was used to identify neural circuits involved in anxiety 
      modulation. Unilateral intra-LS morphine (100 or 500 ng/100 nl) decreased 
      open-arm exploration in the plus-maze and reduced head-dipping frequency in the 
      hole-board, an anxiogenic-like effect associated with decreased Fos expression in 
      the ventral LS, the dorsal hippocampus and the anterior hypothalamus. Anatomical 
      specificity was assessed by injecting morphine into the medial septum, which 
      failed to produce anxiogenesis. Pre-injection of the mu-opioid receptor 
      antagonist naloxonazine (100 ng/100 nl) into LS reversed morphine-induced 
      anxiogenesis and the associated pattern of Fos expression, indicating a specific 
      recruitment of mu-opioid receptors by morphine. Surprisingly, bilateral morphine 
      injections (20 to 500 ng/100 nl) were not found anxiogenic, perhaps due to their 
      stimulant effect. Taken together, these results suggest that LS mu-opioid 
      receptors participate to the modulation of anxiety.

TI  - Intravenous morphine self-administration alters accumbal microRNA profiles in the 
      mouse brain.

LID - 10.4103/1673-5374.224374 [doi]
AB  - A significant amount of evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an 
      important role in drug addiction. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical part 
      of the brain's reward circuit and is involved in a variety of psychiatric 
      disorders, including depression, anxiety, and drug addiction. However, few 
      studies have examined the expression of miRNAs and their functional roles in the 
      NAc under conditions of morphine addiction. In this study, mice were 
      intravenously infused with morphine (0.01, 0.03, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/infusion) and 
      showed inverted U-shaped response. After morphine self-administration, NAc was 
      used to analyze the functional networks of altered miRNAs and their putative 
      target mRNAs in the NAc following intravenous self-administration of morphine. We 
      utilized several bioinformatics tools, including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) pathway mapping and CyTargetLinker. We found that 62 miRNAs were 
      altered and exhibited differential expression patterns. The putative targets were 
      related to diverse regulatory functions, such as neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, 
      and synaptic plasticity, as well as the pharmacological effects of morphine 
      (receptor internalization/endocytosis). The present findings provide novel 
      insights into the regulatory mechanisms of accumbal molecules under conditions of 
      morphine addiction and identify several novel biomarkers associated with morphine 
      addiction.

TI  - Effect of S-COMT deficiency on behavior and extracellular brain dopamine 
      concentrations in mice.
PG  - 389-401
LID - 10.1007/s00213-010-1944-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has soluble (S-COMT) and 
      membrane bound (MB-COMT) isoforms. Our aims were to assess the behavioral 
      phenotype of S-COMT mutant mice and to clarify the role of MB-COMT in dopamine 
      metabolism in different brain areas. METHODS: Behavioral phenotype of the S-COMT 
      mutant mice was assessed using a test battery designed to describe anxiety 
      phenotype, spontaneous locomotor activity, sensorymotor gating, social behavior, 
      and pain sensitivity. Microdialysis was used to explore the effect of S-COMT 
      deficiency on extracellular dopamine under an L: -dopa load (carbidopa /L: -dopa 
      30/10 mg/kg i.p.). RESULTS: In behavioral tests, mature adult S-COMT mutants that 
      only possessed MB-COMT exhibited enhanced acoustic startle without alterations in 
      sensorimotor gating. They also showed barbering of vibrissae and nonaggressive 
      social dominance, suggesting a change in their social interactions. In addition, 
      S-COMT deficiency slightly and sex-dependently affected spinal pain reflex and 
      the effect of morphine on hot-plate latency. In microdialysis studies under L: 
      -dopa load, S-COMT mutants of both sexes had higher accumbal dopamine levels, but 
      male S-COMT mutant mice showed paradoxically lower prefrontal cortical dopamine 
      concentrations than wild-type animals. S-COMT deficiency induced the accumulation 
      of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in all brain areas, which was accentuated after 
      L: -dopa loading. The lack of S-COMT decreased extracellular homovanillic acid 
      levels. However, after L: -dopa loading, homovanillic acid concentrations in the 
      prefrontal cortex of S-COMT mutants were similar to those of wild-type mice. 
      CONCLUSION: A lack of S-COMT has a notable, albeit small, brain-area and 
      sex-dependent effect on the O-methylation of dopamine and 
      3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the mouse brain. It also induces subtle changes 
      in mouse social interaction behaviors and nociception.

AB  - Disturbances in fear-evoked signal transduction in the hippocampus (HP), the 
      nuclei of the amygdala (AMY), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlie 
      anxiety-related disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these 
      effects remain elusive. Heterotrimeric G proteins (GPs) are divided into the 
      following four families based on the intracellular activity of their alpha 
      subunit (Gα): Gα(s) proteins stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) generation, Gα(i/o) 
      proteins inhibit the cAMP pathway, Gα(q/11) proteins increase the intracellular 
      Ca(++) concentration and the inositol trisphosphate level, and Gα(12/13) proteins 
      activate monomeric GP-Rho. In the present study, we assessed the effects of a 
      fear memory procedure on the mRNA expression of the Gα subunits of all four GP 
      families in the HP, AMY and PFC. C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to a fear 
      conditioning (FC) procedure followed by a contextual or cued fear memory test 
      (CTX-R and CS-R, respectively). Morphine (MOR, 1 mg/kg/ip) was injected 
      immediately after FC to prevent the fear consolidation process. Real-time 
      quantitative PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of Gα subunits at 
      1 h after FC, 24 h after FC, and 1 h after the CTX-R or CS-R. In the HP, the mRNA 
      levels of Gα(s), Gα(12) and Gα(11) were higher at 1 h after training. Gα(s) 
      levels were slightly lower when consolidation was stabilized and after the CS-R. 
      The mRNA levels of Gα(12) were increased at 1 h after FC, returned to control 
      levels at 24 h after FC and increased again with the CTX-R. The increase in the 
      Gα(11) level persisted at 24 h after FC and after CTX-R. In the AMY, no specific 
      changes were induced by FC. In the PFC, CTX-R was accompanied by a decrease in 
      Gα(i/o) mRNA levels; however, only Gα(i2) downregulation was prevented by MOR 
      treatment. Hence, the FC-evoked changes in Gα mRNA expression were observed 
      mainly in the HP and connected primarily to contextual learning. These results 
      suggest that the activation of signaling pathways by Gα(s) and Gα(12) is required 
      to begin the fear memory consolidation process in the HP, while signal 
      transduction via Gα(11) is implicated in the maintenance of fear consolidation. 
      In the PFC, the downregulation of Gα(i2) appears to be related to the contextual 
      learning of fear.

TI  - Effects of the beta-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone on nicotine withdrawal and 
      nicotine-induced reinstatement of preference in mice.
PG  - 419-26
LID - 10.1007/s00213-013-3047-3 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Several studies suggest that repeated nicotine administration causes 
      alterations in glutaminergic transmission that may play an important role in 
      developing and maintaining nicotine addiction. Chronic nicotine administration in 
      rats decreases the expression of the glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and 
      cysteine-glutamate exchanger (system xC-) in the nucleus accumbens. We 
      hypothesized that ceftriaxone, a GLT-1 and system xC- activator, would decrease 
      murine behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      investigate the effect of repeated ceftriaxone administration on the behavioral 
      effects of nicotine using mouse models of conditioned reward and withdrawal. 
      METHOD: Using male ICR mice, the ability of repeated ceftriaxone injections to 
      modulate the development and reinstatement of a nicotine-conditioned place 
      preference (CPP) was evaluated. Additionally, nicotine withdrawal-associated 
      signs were assessed. These included both physical (somatic signs and 
      hyperalgesia) and affective (anxiety-related behaviors) withdrawal signs in mice. 
      Finally, the effects of ceftriaxone on nicotine-induced antinociception and 
      hypothermia after acute nicotine injection were measured. RESULT: Ceftriaxone had 
      no effect on the development of nicotine preference but significantly attenuated 
      nicotine-induced reinstatement of CPP. Furthermore, ceftriaxone reversed all 
      nicotine withdrawal signs measured in mice. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these 
      findings show that a β-lactam antibiotic reduces nicotine withdrawal and 
      nicotine-seeking behavior. Our results suggest that the documented efficacy of 
      ceftriaxone against cocaine and morphine dependence-related behaviors effects 
      extends to nicotine.

TI  - Differential regulation of morphine antinociceptive effects by endogenous 
      enkephalinergic system in the forebrain of mice.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/1744-8069-4-41 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mice lacking the preproenkephalin (ppENK) gene are hyperalgesic and 
      show more anxiety and aggression than wild-type (WT) mice. The marked behavioral 
      changes in ppENK knock-out (KO) mice appeared to occur in supraspinal response to 
      painful stimuli. However the functional role of enkephalins in the supraspinal 
      nociceptive processing and their underlying mechanism is not clear. The aim of 
      present study was to compare supraspinal nociceptive and morphine antinociceptive 
      responses between WT and ppENK KO mice. RESULTS: The genotypes of bred KO mice 
      were confirmed by PCR. Met-enkephalin immunoreactive neurons were labeled in the 
      caudate-putamen, intermediated part of lateral septum, lateral globus pallidus, 
      intermediated part of lateral septum, hypothalamus, and amygdala of WT mice. 
      Met-enkephalin immunoreactive neurons were not found in the same brain areas in 
      KO mice. Tail withdrawal and von Frey test results did not differ between WT and 
      KO mice. KO mice had shorter latency to start paw licking than WT mice in the hot 
      plate test. The maximal percent effect of morphine treatments (5 mg/kg and 10 
      mg/kg, i.p.) differed between WT and KO mice in hot plate test. The current 
      source density (CSD) profiles evoked by peripheral noxious stimuli in the primary 
      somatosenstory cortex (S1) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were similar in WT 
      and KO mice. After morphine injection, the amplitude of the laser-evoked sink 
      currents was decreased in S1 while the amplitude of electrical-evoked sink 
      currents was increased in the ACC. These differential morphine effects in S1 and 
      ACC were enhanced in KO mice. Facilitation of synaptic currents in the ACC is 
      mediated by GABA inhibitory interneurons in the local circuitry. Percent 
      increases in opioid receptor binding in S1 and ACC were 5.1% and 5.8%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that the endogenous 
      enkephalin system is not involved in acute nociceptive transmission in the spinal 
      cord, S1, and ACC. However, morphine preferentially suppressed supraspinal 
      related nociceptive behavior in KO mice. This effect was reflected in the 
      potentiated differential effects of morphine in the S1 and ACC in KO mice. This 
      potentiation may be due to an up-regulation of opioid receptors. Thus these 
      findings strongly suggest an antagonistic interaction between the endogenous 
      enkephalinergic system and exogenous opioid analgesic actions in the supraspinal 
      brain structures.

TI  - Social transfer of pain in mice.
PG  - e1600855
LID - e1600855
AB  - A complex relationship exists between the psychosocial environment and the 
      perception and experience of pain, and the mechanisms of the social communication 
      of pain have yet to be elucidated. The present study examined the social 
      communication of pain and demonstrates that "bystander" mice housed and tested in 
      the same room as mice subjected to inflammatory pain or withdrawal from morphine 
      or alcohol develop corresponding hyperalgesia. Olfactory cues mediate the 
      transfer of hyperalgesia to the bystander mice, which can be measured using 
      mechanical, thermal, and chemical tests. Hyperalgesia in bystanders does not 
      co-occur with anxiety or changes in corticosterone and cannot be explained by 
      visually dependent emotional contagion or stress-induced hyperalgesia. These 
      experiments reveal the multifaceted relationship between the social environment 
      and pain behavior and support the use of mice as a model system for investigating 
      these factors. In addition, these experiments highlight the need for proper 
      consideration of how experimental animals are housed and tested.

TI  - Absence of quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome in adenosine A2A receptor knockout 
      mice.
PG  - 160-8
AB  - RATIONALE: Caffeine and other methylxanthines induce behavioral activation and 
      anxiety responses in mice via antagonist action at A2A adenosine receptors. When 
      combined with the opioid antagonist naloxone, methylxanthines produce a 
      characteristic quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome (QMWS) in opiate-naive animals. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish the role of A2A receptors in 
      the quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome induced by co-administration of caffeine 
      and naloxone and in the behavioral effects of caffeine. METHODS: We have used A2A 
      receptor knockout (A(2A)R(-/-)) mice in comparison with their wild-type and 
      heterozygous littermates to measure locomotor activity in the open field and 
      withdrawal symptoms induced by caffeine and naloxone. Naïve wild-type and 
      knockout mice were also examined for enkephalin and dynorphin mRNA expression by 
      in situ hybridization and for mu-opiate receptor by ligand binding 
      autoradiography to check for possible opiate receptor changes induced by A2A 
      receptor inactivation. RESULTS: Caffeine increases locomotion and anxiety in 
      wild-type animals, but it has no psychomotor effects in A(2A)R(-/-) mice. 
      Co-administration of caffeine (20 mg/kg) and naloxone (2 mg/kg) resulted in a 
      severe quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome in wild-type mice that was almost 
      completely abolished in A(2A)R(-/-) mice. Heterozygous animals exhibited a 40% 
      reduction in withdrawal symptoms, suggesting that there is no 
      genetic/developmental compensation for the inactivation of one of the A(2A)R 
      alleles. A(2A)R(-/-) and wild-type mice have similar levels of striatal mu-opioid 
      receptors, thus the effect is not due to altered opioid receptor expression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that A2A receptors are required for the 
      induction of quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome by co-administration of caffeine 
      and naloxone and implicate striatal A2A receptors and mu-opiate receptors in 
      tonic inhibition of motor activity in the striatum.

TI  - Role of Opioid System in Empathy-like Behaviours in Rats.
PG  - 216-222
LID - 10.22122/ahj.v11i4.243 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empathy is defined as the ability to simulate the mental states of 
      others. Recent studies have demonstrated empathy-like behaviors in other animals 
      including rats and mice. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the 
      effect of acute administration of morphine and naloxone on cognition and 
      nociception changes following observing conspecifics undergoing nociceptive 
      stimulus. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were used (n = 8 for each group). One 
      cagemate received formalin injection into the hindpaw five times within a 
      nine-day period and the other cagemate observed the pain while being pretreated 
      with saline, morphine, or naloxone [10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)]. Pain 
      behaviors, anxiety-like behaviour, locomotion, balance and muscle strength were 
      evaluated in the observer animals. FINDINGS: Observing a cagemate in pain 
      increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced thermal pain threshold in the 
      observer animals. Administration of morphine reversed these effects and naloxone 
      did not affect the responses. CONCLUSION: Results of the current study reveal an 
      important role for opioid receptors (ORs) in empathy for pain, so that activation 
      of this system dampens the empathy-like responses.

TI  - NPFFR2 Activates the HPA Axis and Induces Anxiogenic Effects in Rodents.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18081810 [doi]
LID - 1810
AB  - Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) belongs to the RFamide family and is known as a 
      morphine-modulating peptide. NPFF regulates various hypothalamic functions 
      through two receptors, NPFFR1 and NPFFR2. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis participates in physiological stress response by increasing 
      circulating glucocorticoid levels and modulating emotional responses. Other 
      RFamide peptides, including neuropeptide AF, neuropeptide SF and RFamide related 
      peptide also target NPFFR1 or NPFFR2, and have been reported to activate the HPA 
      axis and induce anxiety- or depression-like behaviors. However, little is known 
      about the action of NPFF on HPA axis activity and anxiety-like behaviors, and the 
      role of the individual receptors remains unclear. In this study, NPFFR2 agonists 
      were used to examine the role of NPFFR2 in activating the HPA axis in rodents. 
      Administration of NPFFR2 agonists, dNPA (intracerebroventricular, ICV) and 
      AC-263093 (intraperitoneal, IP), time-dependently (in rats) and dose-dependently 
      (in mice) increased serum corticosteroid levels and the effects were counteracted 
      by the NPFF receptor antagonist, RF9 (ICV), as well as corticotropin-releasing 
      factor (CRF) antagonist, α-helical CRF(9-41) (intravenous, IV). Treatment with 
      NPFFR2 agonist (AC-263093, IP) increased c-Fos protein expression in the 
      hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and induced an anxiogenic effect, which was 
      evaluated in mice using an elevated plus maze. These findings reveal, for the 
      first time, that the direct action of hypothalamic NPFFR2 stimulates the HPA axis 
      and triggers anxiety-like behaviors.

TI  - Perinatal oxycodone exposure causes long-term sex-dependent changes in weight 
      trajectory and sensory processing in adult mice.
PG  - 3859-3873

AB  - RATIONALE: In utero opioid exposure is associated with lower weight and a 
      neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) at birth, along with longer-term 
      adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and mood disorders. While NOWS is sometimes 
      treated with continued opioids, clinical studies have not addressed if long-term 
      neurobehavioral outcomes are worsened with continued postnatal exposure to 
      opioids. In addition, pre-clinical studies comparing in utero only opioid 
      exposure to continued post-natal opioid administration for withdrawal mitigation 
      are lacking. OBJECTIVES: Here, we sought to understand the impact of continued 
      postnatal opioid exposure on long term behavioral consequences. METHODS: We 
      implemented a rodent perinatal opioid exposure model of oxycodone (Oxy) exposure 
      that included Oxy exposure until birth (short Oxy) and continued postnatal opioid 
      exposure (long Oxy) spanning gestation through birth and lactation. RESULTS: 
      Short Oxy exposure was associated with a sex-specific increase in weight gain 
      trajectory in adult male mice. Long Oxy exposure caused an increased weight gain 
      trajectory in adult males and alterations in nociceptive processing in females. 
      Importantly, there was no evidence of long-term social behavioral deficits, 
      anxiety, hyperactivity, or memory deficits following short or long Oxy exposure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that offspring with prolonged opioid exposure 
      experienced some long-term sequelae compared to pups with opioid cessation at 
      birth. These results highlight the potential long-term consequences of opioid 
      administration as a mitigation strategy for clinical NOWS symptomology and 
      suggest alternatives should be explored.

TI  - Pleiotropic impact of constitutive fosB inactivation on nicotine-induced 
      behavioral alterations and stress-related traits in mice.
PG  - 820-36
AB  - Multiple genes are thought to influence both susceptibility to nicotine 
      dependence and its comorbid behavioral traits in humans. However, which specific 
      genes contribute to this pleiotropic effect is poorly understood. Previous rodent 
      studies have shown that many addictive substances and stressful stimuli increase 
      the expression of the transcription factor FosB in limbic and associated regions 
      and that the protein products of fosB contribute to certain behavioral effects of 
      cocaine and morphine. However, the role of this gene in nicotine-regulated 
      behaviors and dependence-related behavioral traits is unknown. We tested the 
      hypothesis that a constitutive level of FosB affects nicotine-regulated behaviors 
      and comorbid behavioral traits using constitutive fosB knockout (KO) mice. 
      Following repeated or prolonged nicotine administration, but not a single acute 
      administration, KO mice were impaired in conditioned place preference, oral 
      nicotine intake and motor suppression. In wild-type mice, repeated nicotine 
      injections, but not a single acute injection, increased the expression of FosB 
      and its truncated variant DeltaFosB in the targets but not at the origins of the 
      mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine pathways; no detectable level of 
      FosB/DeltaFosB was found in KO mice. In tasks designed to assess behavioral 
      traits, KO mice exhibited more pronounced behavioral abnormalities when stress 
      levels were high than when they were minimized. Our results suggest that the 
      constitutive absence of fosB has a pleiotropic influence on the behavioral 
      effects of repeated or prolonged nicotine administration and on stress-related 
      behavioral traits in mice.

AB  - Prenatal stress (PS) exposure leads to cognitive and behavioral alterations in 
      offspring including an increased risk of substance abuse and anxiety disorders. 
      Signalling from dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the 
      mesoaccumbal and mesocortical pathways plays a vital role in drug dependency and 
      anxiety behavior. To provide further knowledge about the changes in drug seeking 
      behavior and anxiety behaviors in prenatally stressed mice, we conducted ex vivo 
      investigations in VTA brain slices of adult male PS offspring to evaluate the 
      effects of two types of PS (physical vs. psychological) on activity of DA 
      neurons. Elevated plus maze (EPM) was used to assess anxiety-like behaviors and 
      conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to evaluate drug reinforcing effects 
      in mice. An increased anxiety-like behavior and preference to morphine was 
      observed in prenatally stressed mice. PS VTA DA cells exhibited greater I(h) 
      current and a higher frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs, which were consistent 
      with a greater degree of pre- or postsynaptic excitability of the VTA. This was 
      confirmed by lower rheobase and lower firing thresholds in PS VTA neurons, as 
      well as increases in spontaneous firing frequency. When taken together, these 
      data suggest that alterations in VTA DA neurons in this mouse model of prenatal 
      stress might be associated with later life alterations in drug seeking and 
      anxiety-like behaviors through their role in mesocortical and mesoaccumbal 
      pathways.

      substrains.

LID - 10.1111/gbb.12393 [doi]
AB  - Opioid abuse in the United States has reached epidemic proportions, with 
      treatment admissions and deaths associated with prescription opioid abuse 
      quadrupling over the past 10 years. Although genetics are theorized to contribute 
      substantially to inter-individual variability in the development, severity and 
      treatment outcomes of opioid abuse/addiction, little direct preclinical study has 
      focused on the behavioral genetics of prescription opioid reinforcement and 
      drug-taking. Herein, we employed different 129 substrains of mice currently 
      available from The Jackson Laboratory (129S1/SvlmJ, 129X1/SvJ, 129S4/SvJaeJ and 
      129P3/J) as a model system of genetic variation and assayed mice for oral opioid 
      intake and reinforcement, as well as behavioral and somatic signs of dependence. 
      All substrains exhibited a dose-dependent increase in oral oxycodone and heroin 
      preference and intake under limited-access procedures and all, but 129S1/SvlmJ 
      mice, exhibited oxycodone reinforcement. Relative to the other substrains, 
      129P3/J mice exhibited higher heroin and oxycodone intake. While 129X1/SvJ 
      exhibited the highest anxiety-like behavior during natural opioid withdrawal, 
      somatic and behavior signs of precipitated withdrawal were most robust in 129P3/J 
      mice. These results demonstrate the feasibility and relative sensitivity of our 
      oral opioid self-administration procedures for detecting substrain differences in 
      drug reinforcement/intake among 129 mice, of relevance to the identification of 
      genetic variants contributing to high vs. low oxycodone reinforcement and intake.

AB  - The endogenous opioid system is expressed throughout the brain reinforcement 
      circuitry, and plays a major role in reward processing, mood control and the 
      development of addiction. This neuromodulator system is composed of three 
      receptors, mu, delta and kappa, interacting with a family of opioid peptides 
      derived from POMC (β-endorphin), preproenkephalin (pEnk) and preprodynorphin 
      (pDyn) precursors. Knockout mice targeting each gene of the opioid system have 
      been created almost two decades ago. Extending classical pharmacology, these 
      mutant mice represent unique tools to tease apart the specific role of each 
      opioid receptor and peptide in vivo, and a powerful approach to understand how 
      the opioid system modulates behavioral effects of drugs of abuse. The present 
      review summarizes these studies, with a focus on major drugs of abuse including 
      morphine/heroin, cannabinoids, psychostimulants, nicotine or alcohol. Genetic 
      data, altogether, set the mu receptor as the primary target for morphine and 
      heroin. In addition, this receptor is essential to mediate rewarding properties 
      of non-opioid drugs of abuse, with a demonstrated implication of β-endorphin for 
      cocaine and nicotine. Delta receptor activity reduces levels of anxiety and 
      depressive-like behaviors, and facilitates morphine-context association. pEnk is 
      involved in these processes and delta/pEnk signaling likely regulates alcohol 
      intake. The kappa receptor mainly interacts with pDyn peptides to limit drug 
      reward, and mediate dysphoric effects of cannabinoids and nicotine. 
      Kappa/dynorphin activity also increases sensitivity to cocaine reward under 
      stressful conditions. The opioid system remains a prime candidate to develop 
      successful therapies in addicted individuals, and understanding opioid-mediated 
      processes at systems level, through emerging genetic and imaging technologies, 
      represents the next challenging goal and a promising avenue in addiction 
      research. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'NIDA 40th Anniversary 
      Issue'.

TI  - Role of α1-GABA(A) receptors in the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus in models 
      of opioid reward, anxiety, and depression.
PG  - 188-199
LID - 10.1177/02698811241227672 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT))-mediated system plays an 
      important role in stress-related psychiatric disorders and substance abuse. Our 
      previous studies showed that stress and drug exposure can modulate the dorsal 
      raphe nucleus (DRN)-5-HT system via γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors. 
      Moreover, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition of serotonergic DRN neurons is 
      required for stress-induced reinstatement of opioid seeking. AIM/METHODS: To 
      further test the role of GABA(A) receptors in the 5-HT system in stress and 
      opioid-sensitive behaviors, our current study generated mice with conditional 
      genetic deletions of the GABA(A) α1 subunit to manipulate GABA(A) receptors in 
      either the DRN or the entire population of 5-HT neurons. The GABA(A) α1 subunit 
      is a constituent of the most abundant GABA(A) subtype in the brain and the most 
      highly expressed subunit in 5-HT DRN neurons. RESULTS: Our results showed that 
      mice with DRN-specific knockout of α1-GABA(A) receptors exhibited a normal 
      phenotype in tests of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as well as swim 
      stress-induced reinstatement of morphine-conditioned place preference. By 
      contrast, mice with 5-HT neuron-specific knockout of α1-GABA(A) receptors 
      exhibited an anxiolytic phenotype at baseline and increased sensitivity to 
      post-morphine withdrawal-induced anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that 
      GABA(A) receptors on 5-HT neurons contribute to anxiety-like behaviors and 
      sensitivity of those behaviors to opioid withdrawal.

TI  - Mild postnatal manipulation reduces proenkephalin mRNA in the striatum in 
      developing mice and increases morphine conditioned place preference in adulthood.
PG  - 122-9
AB  - Stressful events during certain neonatal periods may increase the vulnerability 
      of an individual to develop psychopathology and/or drug dependence later in life. 
      Therefore, in the present study, we assessed activity levels, emotionality, 
      sensitivity to the effects of morphine, as well as expression of proenkephalin 
      and prodynorphin in several brain regions in 35 and 90-day-old male mice, 
      subjected to postnatal manipulation consisting in brief exposures to clean 
      bedding (CB). In comparison with controls, CB mice showed reduced emotionality 
      expressed as percentage of time in open arms of the elevated plus maze both at 35 
      days of life and in adulthood. Increased nociceptive threshold was also present 
      in both time points measured. Conversely, higher locomotor activity was recorded 
      in 35 days of life but not in adulthood. Analysis of film autoradiograms revealed 
      no changes in prodynorphin mRNA level, but statistically significant decrease in 
      the level of proenkephalin mRNA in striatum in young CB mice in comparison with 
      young controls; no difference was observed between adult CB and control animals. 
      CB adult mice also showed hypersensitivity to the rewarding effect of morphine in 
      comparison with controls in the place preference test. In conclusion, our results 
      revealed that in the critical period of development the effects of manipulation 
      were evident, not only on behavioral responses but also on the neurochemical 
      markers considered in the present research. Postnatal manipulation could induce 
      changes in the dynamic neuronal processes occurring during development with 
      long-term behavioral effects.

TI  - Role of fosB in behaviours related to morphine reward and spatial memory.
PG  - 212-7
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.02.040 [doi]
AB  - The immediate early genes (IEGs) have been suggested to be implicated in 
      mechanisms of addiction, as well as in learning and memory processes. fosB, which 
      belongs to IEG, has been reported to have pleiotropic impact on response to 
      psychoactive drugs, as well as motivational and stress-related behaviours. In the 
      present study, we used mice with constitutive knock-out of fosB in order to study 
      fosB role in mouse phenotype. We studied rewarding properties of morphine 
      (10mg/kg i.p.) in conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Additionally, we 
      studied fosB role in spatial memory and spatial working memory using elevated 
      plus maze model of spatial learning (EPMSL) and delayed non-match to place task 
      (DNMTP). In further studies, locomotor, depressive-like and anxiety-like 
      behaviours were measured. Rewarding effects of morphine in fosB -/- mice were 
      abolished whereas spatial learning was impaired. On the other hand, we found no 
      significant differences in locomotor activity, depression-like and anxiety-like 
      behaviours. In summary, our results indicate that mice lacking fosB are less 
      sensitive to rewarding properties of morphine and display spatial memory 
      impairment and suggest involvement of fosB and its proteins in motivational 
      aspects of reinforcers as well as in learning and memory processes.

TI  - Effect of diazepam and midazolam on the antinociceptive effect of morphine, 
      metamizol and indomethacin in mice.
PG  - 89-91
AB  - The influence of midazolam and diazepam on antinociceptive effect of morphine (10 
      mg/kg), metamizol (500 mg/kg) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) was investigated in a 
      mouse model using the tail-flick and hot-plate tests. All drugs were injected 
      intraperitoneally. Benzodiazepines were administered to mice 30 min before 
      applying the analgesic drugs. Measurement of nociception was performed within 2 h 
      after benzodiazepine administration. Diazepam at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 2.5 
      mg/kg injected with morphine was found to decrease the antinociceptive effect of 
      morphine. Similarly, diazepam decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol 
      (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin. Midazolam used at doses of 1.25 
      mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, metamizol 
      (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.

TI  - Morphine dependence with or without tolerance in formalin-treated mice: further 
      evidence for the dissociation.
PG  - 277-80
AB  - Pain associated-anxiety induced by formalin, which resulted in a significant 
      delay in the development of tolerance to morphine antinociception, failed to 
      prevent the development of physical dependence as evidenced by naloxone 
      challenge. Dependence also developed in mice rendered tolerant to morphine. Thus, 
      the development of morphine dependence was observed in the absence and presence 
      of tolerance to morphine antinociception; Our results further confirm the 
      dissociation of opioid tolerance and dependence in the animal model of 
      experimental pain/anxiety.

TI  - Opioid-Induced Signaling and Antinociception Are Modulated by the Recently 
      Deorphanized Receptor, GPR171.
PG  - 56-62
LID - 10.1124/jpet.119.259242 [doi]
AB  - ProSAAS is one of the most widely expressed proteins throughout the brain and was 
      recently found to be upregulated in chronic fibromyalgia patients. BigLEN is a 
      neuropeptide that is derived from ProSAAS and was recently discovered to be the 
      endogenous ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR171. Although 
      BigLEN-GPR171 has been found to play a role in feeding and anxiety behaviors, it 
      has not yet been explored in pain and opioid modulation. The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate this novel neuropeptide-receptor system in opioid-induced 
      antinociception. We found that GPR171 is expressed in GABAergic neurons within 
      the periaqueductal gray, which is a key brain area involved in pain modulation 
      and opioid functions. We also found that, although the GPR171 agonist and 
      antagonist do not have nociceptive effects on their own, they oppositely regulate 
      morphine-induced antinociception with the agonist enhancing and antagonist 
      reducing antinociception. Lastly, we showed that the GPR171 antagonist or 
      receptor knockdown decreases signaling by the mu-opioid receptor, but not the 
      delta-opioid receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that antagonism of 
      the GPR171 receptor reduces mu opioid receptor signaling and morphine-induced 
      antinociception, whereas the GPR171 agonist enhances morphine antinociception, 
      suggesting that GPR171 may be a novel target toward the development of pain 
      therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: GPR171 is a recently deorphanized receptor 
      that is expressed within the periaqueductal gray and can regulate mu opioid 
      receptor signaling and antinociception. This research may contribute to the 
      development of new therapeutics to treat pain.

TI  - Abuse potential and adverse cognitive effects of mitragynine (kratom).
PG  - 98-110
LID - 10.1111/adb.12185 [doi]
AB  - Mitragynine is the major psychoactive alkaloid of the plant kratom/ketum. Kratom 
      is widely used in Southeast Asia as a recreational drug, and increasingly appears 
      as a pure compound or a component of 'herbal high' preparations in the Western 
      world. While mitragynine/kratom may have analgesic, muscle relaxant and 
      anti-inflammatory effects, its addictive properties and effects on cognitive 
      performance are unknown. We isolated mitragynine from the plant and performed a 
      thorough investigation of its behavioural effects in rats and mice. Here we 
      describe an addictive profile and cognitive impairments of acute and chronic 
      mitragynine administration, which closely resembles that of morphine. Acute 
      mitragynine has complex effects on locomotor activity. Repeated administration 
      induces locomotor sensitization, anxiolysis and conditioned place preference, 
      enhances expression of dopamine transporter- and dopamine receptor-regulating 
      factor mRNA in the mesencephalon. While there was no increase in spontaneous 
      locomotor activity during withdrawal, animals showed hypersensitivity towards 
      small challenging doses for up to 14 days. Severe somatic withdrawal signs 
      developed after 12 hours, and increased level of anxiety became evident after 24 
      hours of withdrawal. Acute mitragynine independently impaired passive avoidance 
      learning, memory consolidation and retrieval, possibly mediated by a disruption 
      of cortical oscillatory activity, including the suppression of low-frequency 
      rhythms (delta and theta) in the electrocorticogram. Chronic mitragynine 
      administration led to impaired passive avoidance and object recognition learning. 
      Altogether, these findings provide evidence for an addiction potential with 
      cognitive impairments for mitragynine, which suggest its classification as a 
      harmful drug.

TI  - Mianserin and trazodone significantly attenuate the intensity of opioid 
      withdrawal symptoms in mice.
PG  - 107-14
AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of trazodone and mianserin on 
      opioid-withdrawal symptoms in morphine-dependent mice. We used a comparative 
      study of the effect of each drug on withdrawal symptoms in one model of acutely 
      high-dose morphine-dependent mice, and two models (high-dose and lu-dose) of 
      chronically morphine-dependent mice at the Tel Aviv University Sackler School of 
      Medicine's laboratory.Trazodone, mianserin or both were given to the 
      morphine-dependent mice together with a high dose of naloxone. Intensity of 
      withdrawal symptoms was evaluated by tail-flick assay latencies and three 
      behavioural measurements (rearing, jumping and grooming) in each group. Trazodone 
      and mianserin, each separately,significantly attenuated withdrawal symptoms in 
      all three models. However, the combined treatment of trazodone together with 
      mianserin was not superior to each drug alone. The combination of trazodone and 
      mianserin has no additive value to each drug alone in the control of withdrawal 
      symptoms in opiate-dependent mice undergoing detoxification. When used in 
      clinical settings, caution is needed in order to prevent the unknown influence of 
      opioid-like drugs in medication-assisted detoxification programmes if complete 
      opiate detoxification is the aim.

TI  - Comparative study in mice of tetrazepam and other centrally active skeletal 
      muscle relaxants.
PG  - 272-85
AB  - Tetrazepam is a 1,4 benzodiazepine (BZD) clinically used in France and Germany as 
      a muscle relaxant. The activity of tetrazepam was compared to that of diazepam, 
      baclofen, mephenesin and chlormezanone in mice, in pharmacological models which 
      are predictive of muscle relaxant and sedative properties. Tetrazepam was active 
      in all the 6 tests of muscle relaxation (traction, chimney, inclined screen, grip 
      force, horizontal grid and morphine-induced Straub tail). The overall muscle 
      relaxant potency of tetrazepam was inferior to that of diazepam, but was clearly 
      superior to that of chlormezanone and mephenesin. Baclofen was less active than 
      tetrazepam in 3 tests (traction, horizontal grid, and grip strength), but more 
      active in the other 3 tests. The administration of the benzodiazepine receptor 
      antagonist Ro 15-1788 blocked the effects of tetrazepam and diazepam in 2 
      representative tests, morphine-induced Straub tail and the rotarod test, but did 
      not modify the activities of the other centrally acting muscle relaxants in these 
      same models. The selectivity ratio (ED50 rotarod or ED50 locomotor activity/ED50 
      in each muscle relaxant test) for tetrazepam was superior to that of diazepam and 
      all the other muscle relaxant drugs examined. It is concluded that tetrazepam 
      exerts its muscle relaxant activity by stimulating central BZD receptors, and 
      presents the advantage of a wide dissociation between muscle relaxant and 
      sedative potencies.

TI  - Neurobehavioral effects of neonatal opioid exposure in mice: Influence of the 
      OPRM1 SNP.
PG  - e12806
LID - 10.1111/adb.12806 [doi]
AB  - Opioid use among pregnant women is a growing public health concern in the United 
      States. Infants exposed to opioids in utero are at risk of exhibiting neonatal 
      opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). The biological mechanisms underlying short and 
      long-term consequences of in utero opioid exposure and NOWS are unknown. A 
      potential genetic factor is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 
      mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1 A118G). Opioid exposed infants with the G-allele 
      spend less time in hospitals after birth. To determine whether this SNP modulates 
      the neurobehavioral effects of neonatal opioid exposure and withdrawal, we used 
      mice possessing the equivalent Oprm1 SNP (A112G). Pups were treated chronically 
      with saline or morphine from postnatal days (PNDs) 1 to 14, a developmental 
      period equivalent to the third trimester of a human pregnancy and a sensitive 
      period for opioid exposure in rodents. Morphine treatment produced significant 
      developmental delays regardless of genotype and increased total ultrasonic 
      vocalizations in males during spontaneous withdrawal. Animals were aged and 
      tested for anxiety and drug response during adolescence and adulthood, 
      respectively. AA morphine-treated animals showed reduced activity in the marble 
      burying task compared with saline controls; however, this effect was absent in AG 
      and GG animals. As adults, AA males exposed to morphine from PNDs 1 to 14 
      exhibited enhanced development of locomotor sensitization to morphine, whereas 
      females showed reduced locomotor sensitization. These data suggest the 
      involvement of the Oprm1 SNP for certain outcomes of neonatal opioid exposure and 
      highlight the importance of considering sex and genetic variability for the 
      prognosis of NOWS.

TI  - Chronic activation of NPFFR2 stimulates the stress-related depressive behaviors

AB  - Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is a morphine-modulating peptide that regulates the 
      analgesic effect of opioids, and also controls food consumption and 
      cardiovascular function through its interaction with two cognate receptors, 
      NPFFR1 and NPFFR2. In the present study, we explore a novel modulatory role for 
      NPFF-NPFFR2 in stress-related depressive behaviors. In a mouse model of chronic 
      mild stress (CMS)-induced depression, the expression of NPFF significantly 
      increased in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and 
      amygdala. In addition, transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing NPFFR2 displayed 
      clear depression and anxiety-like behaviors with hyperactivity in the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, reduced expression of glucocorticoid 
      receptor (GR) and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, acute treatment 
      of NPFFR2 agonists in wild-type (WT) mice enhanced the activity of the HPA axis, 
      and chronic administration resulted in depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. 
      Chronic stimulation of NPFFR2 also decreased the expression of hippocampal GR and 
      led to persistent activation of the HPA axis. Strikingly, bilateral 
      intra-paraventricular nucleus (PVN) injection of NPFFR2 shRNA predominately 
      inhibits the depressive-like behavior in CMS-exposed mice. Antidepressants, 
      fluoxetine and ketamine, effectively relieved the depressive behaviors of 
      NPFFR2-Tg mice. We speculate that persistent NPFFR2 activation, in particular in 
      the hypothalamus, up-regulates the HPA axis and results in long-lasting increases 
      in circulating corticosterone (CORT), consequently damaging hippocampal function. 
      This novel role of NPFFR2 in regulating the HPA axis and hippocampal function 
      provides a new avenue for combating depression and anxiety-like disorder.

TI  - Parvalbumin Interneurons of Central Amygdala Regulate the Negative Affective 
      States and the Expression of Corticotrophin-Releasing Hormone During Morphine 
      Withdrawal.
LID - pyw060 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyw060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a crucial component of 
      the neuronal circuitry mediating aversive emotion. Its role in the negative 
      affective states during drug withdrawal includes changes in opioidergic, 
      GABAergic, and corticotropin-releasing factor neurotransmission. However, the 
      modulation of the neurobiological interconnectivity in the CeA and its effects in 
      the negative reinforcement of drug dependents are poorly understood. METHOD: We 
      performed electrophysiological recordings to assess the membrane excitability of 
      parvalbumin (PV)(+) interneurons in the CeA during chronic morphine withdrawal. 
      We tested the morphine withdrawal-induced negative affective states, such as the 
      aversive (assessed by conditioned place aversion), anxiety (assessed by elevated 
      plus maze), and anhedonic-like (assessed by saccharin preference test) behaviors, 
      as well as the mRNA level of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) via 
      optogenetic inhibition or activation of PV(+) interneurons in the CeA. RESULT: 
      Chronic morphine withdrawal increased the firing rate of CeA PV(+) interneurons. 
      Optogenetic inhibition of the activity of CeA PV(+) interneurons attenuated the 
      morphine withdrawal-induced negative affective states, such as the aversive, 
      anxiety, and anhedonic-like behaviors, while direct activation of CeA PV(+) 
      interneurons could trigger those negative affective-like behaviors. Optogenetic 
      inhibition of the CeA PV(+) interneurons during the morphine withdrawal 
      significantly attenuated the elevated CRH mRNA level in the CeA. CONCLUSION: The 
      activity of PV(+) interneurons in the CeA was up-regulated during chronic 
      morphine withdrawal. The activation of PV(+) interneurons during morphine 
      withdrawal was crucial for the induction of the negative emotion and the 
      up-regulation of CRH mRNA levels in the CeA.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has shown remarkable effects in improving cognition 
      and addictive behaviour. We tested whether EE could help recover from prenatal 
      stress exposure. Mature Swiss Webster male and virgin female mice were placed 
      together until vaginal plugs were detectable. Next, pregnant rodents were 
      randomized into the control, physically and psychologically stressed groups. The 
      application of stress was initiated on the 10th day of pregnancy and persisted 
      for a week to induce stress in the mice. Open field and elevated plus-maze (EPM) 
      tests were utilized as explorative and anxiety assays, respectively. A passive 
      avoidance shuttle-box test was carried out to check anxiety-modulated behaviour. 
      Morris water maze (MWM) test was undertaken to evaluate spatial learning and 
      memory. Conditioned place preference (CPP) test was selected for evaluation of 
      tendency to morphine consumption. Our results showed that prenatal stress 
      elevated anxiety-like behaviour in the offspring which EE could significantly 
      alleviate after weaning. We also found a higher preference for morphine use in 
      the physical stress and psychological stress offspring group. However, no 
      difference was observed among the genders. Application of EE for the stress group 
      improved several parameters of the cognitive behaviour significantly. Although 
      prenatal stress can lead to detrimental behavioural and cognitive outcomes, it 
      can in part be relieved by early exposure to EE. However, some outcomes linked to 
      prenatal stress exposure may not be diminished by EE therapy. In light of such 
      irreversible effects, large-scale preventive actions promoting avoidance from 
      stress during pregnancy should be advised.

TI  - Fluoxetine reverses the behavioral despair induced by neurogenic stress in mice: 
      role of N-methyl-d-aspartate and opioid receptors.
PG  - 599-612
LID - 10.1139/cjpp-2015-0429 [doi]
AB  - Opioid and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate different effects of 
      fluoxetine. We investigated whether opioid and NMDA receptors are involved in the 
      protective effect of fluoxetine against the behavioral despair induced by acute 
      physical stress in male mice. We used the forced swimming test (FST), tail 
      suspension test (TST), and open-field test (OFT) for behavioral evaluation. We 
      used fluoxetine, naltrexone (opioid receptor antagonist), MK-801 (NMDA receptor 
      antagonist), morphine (opioid receptor agonist), and NMDA (NMDA receptor 
      agonist). Acute foot-shock stress (FSS) significantly induced behavioral despair 
      (depressive-like) and anxiety-like behaviors in tests. Fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) 
      reversed the depressant-like effect of FSS, but it did not alter the locomotion 
      and anxiety-like behavior in animals. Acute administration of subeffective doses 
      of naltrexone (0.3 mg/kg) or MK-801 (0.01 mg/kg) potentiated the 
      antidepressant-like effect of fluoxetine, while subeffective doses of morphine (1 
      mg/kg) and NMDA (75 mg/kg) abolished this effect of fluoxetine. Also, 
      co-administration of subeffective doses of naltrexone (0.05 mg/kg) and MK-801 
      (0.003 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (1 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease in the 
      immobility time in FST and TST. Our results showed that opioid and NMDA receptors 
      (alone or in combination) are involved in the antidepressant-like effect of 
      fluoxetine against physical stress.

TI  - Unpleasant and anticonflict effects of nicotine observed by conditioned taste 
      aversion and hypertonic NaCl solution tests in mice.
PG  - 193-201
AB  - Effects of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered nicotine on preference for 0.1% 
      saccharin solution and rejection for hypertonic (2%) NaCl solution were 
      investigated in water-deprived mice. The results were compared with those after 
      s.c. administration of methamphetamine, caffeine and morphine. When nicotine 0.3 
      and 1 mg/kg, methamphetamine 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg, and caffeine 30 mg/kg were 
      administered to mice immediately after intake of the saccharin solution, they 
      exhibited a significant decrease in the preference for saccharin solution on the 
      next day (namely conditioned aversion), even though no drug administration was 
      carried out. However, 2.5-10 mg/kg of morphine produced no marked change in the 
      preference. Daily administration for 5 days of nicotine 1 mg/kg, methamphetamine 
      2 mg/kg, caffeine 30 mg/kg, and morphine 10 mg/kg did not produce any marked 
      change in the individual drug effects on the conditioned taste aversion. On the 
      other hand, rejection for the hypertonic NaCl solution was significantly 
      attenuated when nicotine 0.3 mg/kg was administered prior to the experiment, 
      probably showing an anticonflict effect. Caffeine 10 mg/kg, and morphine 2.5 and 
      5 mg/kg also attenuated the rejection for hypertonic NaCl solution. In contrast, 
      methamphetamine 0.25-2 mg/kg enhanced the rejection in a dose-dependent manner. 
      The present results suggest that, in spite of the same dose, nicotine shows both 
      unpleasant and anticonflict (antianxiety) effects dependent on the environmental 
      situation such as stimulus, timing of the drug administration etc. Furthermore, 
      it is notable that the effects of nicotine observed in our experiments were 
      similar to those of caffeine.

TI  - NrCAM-regulating neural systems and addiction-related behaviors.
PG  - 343-53
LID - 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2012.00469.x [doi]
AB  - We have previously shown that a haplotype associated with decreased NrCAM 
      expression in brain is protective against addiction vulnerability for 
      polysubstance abuse in humans and that Nrcam knockout mice do not develop 
      conditioned place preferences for morphine, cocaine or amphetamine. In order to 
      gain insight into NrCAM involvement in addiction vulnerability, which may involve 
      specific neural circuits underlying behavioral characteristics relevant to 
      addiction, we evaluated several behavioral phenotypes in Nrcam knockout mice. 
      Consistent with a potential general reduction in motivational function, Nrcam 
      knockout mice demonstrated less curiosity for novel objects and for an unfamiliar 
      conspecific, showed also less anxiety in the zero maze. Nrcam heterozygote 
      knockout mice reduced alcohol preference and buried fewer marbles in home cage. 
      These observations provide further support for a role of NrCAM in substance abuse 
      including alcoholism vulnerability, possibly through its effects on behavioral 
      traits that may affect addiction vulnerability, including novelty seeking, 
      obsessive compulsion and responses to aversive or anxiety-provoking stimuli. 
      Additionally, in order to prove glutamate homeostasis hypothesis of addiction, we 
      analyzed glutamatergic molecules regulated by NRCAM expression. Glutaminase 
      appears to be involved in NrCAM-related molecular pathway in two different 
      tissues from human and mouse. An inhibitor of the enzyme, 
      prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide, treatment produced, at least, some of the phenotypes 
      of mice shown in alcohol preference and in anxiety-like behavior. Thus, NrCAM 
      could affect addiction-related behaviors via at least partially modulation of 
      some glutamatergic pathways and neural function in brain.

AB  - The role of kappa-opioid receptors (KOR) in the regulation of alcohol-related 
      behaviors is not completely understood. For example, alcohol consumption has been 
      reported to increase following treatment with KOR antagonists in rats, but was 
      decreased in mice with genetic deletion of KOR. Recent studies have further 
      suggested that KOR antagonists may selectively decrease alcohol 
      self-administration in rats following a history of dependence. We assessed the 
      effects of the KOR antagonist JDTic on alcohol self-administration, reinstatement 
      of alcohol seeking induced by alcohol-associated cues or stress, and acute 
      alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety ('hangover anxiety'). JDTic dose-dependently 
      reversed hangover anxiety when given 48 hours prior to testing, a time interval 
      corresponding to the previously demonstrated anxiolytic efficacy of this drug. In 
      contrast, JDTic decreased alcohol self-administration and cue-induced 
      reinstatement of alcohol seeking when administered 2 hours prior to testing, but 
      not at longer pre-treatment times. For comparison, we determined that the 
      prototypical KOR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine can suppress self-administration 
      of alcohol at 2 hours pre-treatment time, mimicking our observations with JDTic. 
      The effects of JDTic were behaviorally specific, as it had no effect on 
      stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking, self-administration of sucrose, 
      or locomotor activity. Further, we demonstrate that at a 2 hours pre-treatment 
      time JDTic antagonized the antinociceptive effects of the KOR agonist U50,488H 
      but had no effect on morphine-induced behaviors. Our results provide additional 
      evidence for the involvement of KOR in regulation of alcohol-related behaviors 
      and provide support for KOR antagonists, including JDTic, to be evaluated as 
      medications for alcoholism.

TI  - Involvement of pain associated anxiety in the development of morphine tolerance 
      in formalin treated mice.
PG  - 313-7
AB  - The mechanism underlying the previous findings that the development of 
      antinociceptive tolerance to morphine was significantly delayed in the presence 
      of inflammatory pain induced by formalin was examined. Measurements of the pain 
      threshold at different time intervals have shown that pain lasts around one week 
      in the formalin treated mice. A single dose of indomethacin (10 mg/kg) or aspirin 
      (400 mg/kg), 30 min before formalin injection, and daily 400 mg/kg of aspirin had 
      no effects on the pain threshold or swelling, and it also did not affect the 
      delay of morphine tolerance development. Daily administration of diazepam, 1 
      mg/kg, 1 hr before morphine injection completely abolished the delay. This effect 
      was antagonized by 2 mg/kg of flumazenil, administered 15 min before diazepam 
      injection. These results suggest that pain-associated anxiety participates in the 
      delay of morphine tolerance development and consequently the 
      benzodiazepine-receptor complex plays a role in the development of morphine 
      tolerance during a painful state.

AB  - The misuse of and addiction to opioids are serious public health problems in some 
      countries, such as the USA. Drug addiction is a chronic and relapsing medical 
      condition that involves motivational and memory-related processes due to the 
      strong associations between drugs and consuming-related stimuli. These stimuli 
      usually trigger continuous and compulsive use and are associated with relapses 
      after periods of withdrawal. Several factors contribute to relapse, including 
      withdrawal-induced mood changes. Therefore, drugs attenuating withdrawal-induced 
      affective alterations could be useful alternative treatments for relapse 
      prevention. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic component from the Cannabis 
      sativa plant, has anti-anxiety and anti-stress properties and has been 
      investigated as an alternative for the treatment of several mental disorders, 
      including drug addiction. Here, we evaluated if CBD administered 30 min prior to 
      test for a conditioned place aversion (CPA) would attenuate the aversion induced 
      by morphine withdrawal precipitated by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone in 
      male C57BL/6 mice. We also investigated if this effect involves the activation of 
      5-HT1A receptors, a mechanism previously associated with CBD anti-aversive 
      effects. As expected, morphine-treated mice spent less time exploring the 
      compartment paired with the naloxone-induced withdrawal, indicating a CPA induced 
      by naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. This effect was not observed in 
      animals treated with CBD, at 30 and 60 mg/kg, prior to the CPA test, indicating 
      that CBD attenuated the expression of CPA induced by naloxone-precipitated 
      morphine withdrawal. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 
      (0.3 mg/kg) blocked CBD effects. Our findings suggest that CBD may reduce the 
      expression of a previously established conditioned aversion induced by morphine 
      withdrawal by a mechanism involving the activation of 5-HT1A receptors. Thus, CBD 
      may be a therapeutic alternative for preventing relapse to opioid addiction by 
      decreasing withdrawal-induced negative affective changes.

AB  - Despite the thousands of lives lost during the ongoing opioid crisis, a scarcity 
      of new and effective clinical treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) remains. 
      To address this unmet need, some researchers have turned to dissociative and 
      psychedelic drugs to treat multiple psychiatric conditions. In particular, low 
      doses of ketamine have been shown to attenuate opioid withdrawal and drug use in 
      clinical and preclinical studies. However, ketamine has misuse liability and 
      dissociative side effects that may limit its widespread application as a 
      treatment for OUD. More recently, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), a ketamine 
      metabolite that lacks misuse potential, has gained attention for its 
      effectiveness in depression and stress models. To uncover its role in OUD, we 
      tested the time-dependent effects of (2R,6R)-HNK on oxycodone withdrawal and 
      reinstatement of oxycodone conditioned place preference (CPP). In male and female 
      oxycodone-dependent mice, we found that 24h pretreatment with (2R,6R)-HNK (10 or 
      30mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the frequency of withdrawal-like behaviors and global 
      withdrawal scores during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, whereas 1h 
      pretreatment with (2R,6R)-HNK only reduced paw tremors and the sum of global 
      withdrawal scores but not GWS Z-scores. In other experiments, both 1h and 24h 
      pretreatment with (2R,6R)-HNK (30mg/kg, s.c.) blocked drug-induced reinstatement 
      of oxycodone CPP. Finally, we found (2R,6R)-HNK (30mg/kg, sc) had no effect on 
      locomotor activity and thigmotaxis. Together, these results indicate that acute 
      (2R,6R)-HNK has efficacy in some preclinical models of OUD without producing 
      locomotor or anxiety-like side effects.

AB  - Opioid drugs are increasingly being prescribed to pregnant women. Such compounds 
      can also bind and activate opioid receptors in the fetal brain, which could lead 
      to long-term brain and behavioral disruptions. We hypothesized that maternal 
      treatment with oxycodone (OXY), the primary opioid at the center of the current 
      crisis, leads to later neurobehavioral disorders and gene expression changes in 
      the hypothalamus and hippocampus of resulting offspring. Female mice were treated 
      daily with 5 mg OXY/kg or saline solution (control; CTL) for two weeks before 
      breeding and then throughout gestation. Male and female offspring from both 
      groups were tested with a battery of behavioral and metabolic tests to measure 
      cognition, exploratory-like, anxiety-like, voluntary physical activity, and 
      socio-communication behaviors. qPCR analyses were performed for candidate gene 
      expression patterns in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of OXY and CTL derived 
      offspring. Developmental exposure to OXY caused socio-communication changes that 
      persisted from weaning through adulthood. Such offspring also showed cognitive 
      impairments, reduced voluntary physical activity, and weighed more than CTL 
      counterparts. In the hippocampus, prenatal exposure to OXY caused sex-dependent 
      differences in expression of genes encoding opioid receptors and those involved 
      in serotonin signaling. OXY exposure induced changes in neuropeptide hormone 
      expression and the epigenetic modulator, Dnmt3a, in the hypothalamus, which could 
      result in epigenetic changes in this brain region. The findings suggest cause for 
      concern that consumption of OXY by pregnant mothers may result in permanent 
      neurobehavioral changes in their offspring. Further work is needed to determine 
      the potential underpinning epigenetic mechanisms.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops in 
      predisposed individuals following a terrifying event. Studies on isogenic animal 
      populations might explain susceptibility to PTSD by revealing associations 
      between the molecular and behavioural consequences of traumatic stress. Our study 
      employed four inbred mouse strains to search for differences in post-stress 
      response to a 1.5-mA electric foot shock. One day to 6 weeks after the foot shock 
      anxiety, depression and addiction-like phenotypes were assessed. In addition, 
      expression levels of selected stress-related genes were analysed in hippocampus 
      and amygdala. C57BL/6J mice exhibited up-regulation in the expression of Tsc22d3, 
      Nfkbia, Plat and Crhr1 genes in both brain regions. These alterations were 
      associated with an increase of sensitized fear and depressive-like behaviour over 
      time. Traumatic stress induced expression of Tsc22d3, Nfkbia, Plat and Fkbp5 
      genes and developed social withdrawal in DBA/2J mice. In 129P3/J strain, exposure 
      to stress produced the up-regulation of Tsc22d3 and Nfkbia genes and enhanced 
      sensitivity to the rewarding properties of morphine. Whereas, SWR/J mice 
      displayed increase only in Pdyn expression in the amygdala and had the lowest 
      conditioned fear. Our results reveal a complex genetic background of phenotypic 
      variation in response to stress and indicate the SWR/J strain as a valuable model 
      of stress resistance. We found potential links between the alterations in 
      expression of Tsc22d3, Nfkbia and Pdyn, and different aspects of susceptibility 
      to stress.

TI  - Gene-environment interaction during early development in the heterozygous reeler 
      mouse: clues for modelling of major neurobehavioral syndromes.
PG  - 560-72
LID - 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Autism and schizophrenia are multifactorial disorders with increasing prevalence 
      in the young population. Among candidate molecules, reelin (RELN) is a protein of 
      the extracellular matrix playing a key role in brain development and synaptic 
      plasticity. The heterozygous (HZ) reeler mouse provides a model for studying the 
      role of reelin deficiency for the onset of these syndromes. We investigated 
      whether early indices of neurobehavioral disorders can be identified in the 
      infant reeler, and whether the consequences of ontogenetic adverse experiences 
      may question or support the suitability of this model. A first study focused on 
      the link between early exposure to Chlorpyryfos and its enduring neurobehavioral 
      consequences. Our data are interesting in view of recently discovered cholinergic 
      abnormalities in autism and schizophrenia, and may suggest new avenues for early 
      pharmacological intervention. In a second study, we analyzed the consequences of 
      repeated maternal separation early in ontogeny. The results provide evidence of 
      how unusual stress early in development are converted into altered behavior in 
      some, but not all, individuals depending on gender and genetic background. A 
      third study aimed to verify the reliability of the model at critical age windows. 
      Data suggest reduced anxiety, increased impulsivity and disinhibition, and 
      altered pain threshold in response to morphine for HZ, supporting a differential 
      organization of brain dopaminergic, serotonergic and opioid systems in this 
      genotype. In conclusion, HZ exhibited a complex behavioral and 
      psycho-pharmacological phenotype, and differential responsivity to ontogenetic 
      adverse conditions. HZ may be used to disentangle interactions between genetic 
      vulnerability and environmental factors. Such an approach could help to model the 
      pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental psychiatric diseases.

TI  - BDNF parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway in morphine-induced analgesia.
PG  - 1649-60
LID - 10.1017/S146114571200168X [doi]
AB  - In addition to its neurotrophic role, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is 
      involved in a wide array of functions, including anxiety and pain. The central 
      amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) contains a high concentration of BDNF in terminals, 
      originating from the pontine parabrachial nucleus. Since the 
      spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid neural pathway is known to convey nociceptive 
      information, we hypothesized a possible involvement of BDNF in supraspinal 
      pain-related processes. To test this hypothesis, we generated localized deletion 
      of BDNF in the parabrachial nucleus using local bilateral injections of 
      adeno-associated viruses in adult floxed-BDNF mice. Basal thresholds of thermal 
      and mechanical nociceptive responses were not altered by BDNF loss and no 
      behavioural deficit was noticed in anxiety and motor tests. However, BDNF-deleted 
      animals displayed a major decrease in the analgesic effect of morphine. In 
      addition, intra-CeA injections of the BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc in control mice also 
      decreased morphine-induced analgesia. Finally, the number of c-Fos immunoreactive 
      nuclei after acute morphine injection was decreased by 45% in the extended 
      amygdala of BDNF-deleted animals. The absence of BDNF in the parabrachial nucleus 
      thus altered the parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway. Overall, our study provides 
      evidence that BDNF produced in the parabrachial nucleus modulates the functions 
      of the parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway in opiate analgesia.

TI  - SGIP1 is involved in regulation of emotionality, mood, and nociception and 
      modulates in vivo signalling of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors.
PG  - 1588-1604
LID - 10.1111/bph.15383 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Src homology 3-domain growth factor receptor-bound 2-like 
      endophilin interacting protein 1 (SGIP1) interacts with cannabinoid CB(1) 
      receptors. SGIP1 is abundantly and principally expressed within the nervous 
      system. SGIP1 and CB(1) receptors co-localize in axons and presynaptic boutons. 
      SGIP1 interferes with the internalization of activated CB(1) receptors in 
      transfected heterologous cells. Consequently, the transient association of CB(1) 
      receptors with β-arrestin2 is enhanced and prolonged, and CB(1) receptor-mediated 
      ERK1/2 signalling is decreased. Because of these actions, SGIP1 may modulate 
      affect, anxiety, pain processing, and other physiological processes controlled by 
      the endocannabinoid system (ECS). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using a battery of 
      behavioural tests, we investigated the consequences of SGIP1 deletion in tasks 
      regulated by the ECS in SGIP1 constitutive knockout (SGIP1(-/-) ) mice. KEY 
      RESULTS: In SGIP1(-/-) mice, sensorimotor gating, exploratory levels, and working 
      memory are unaltered. SGIP1(-/-) mice have decreased anxiety-like behaviours. 
      Fear extinction to tone is facilitated in SGIP1(-/-) females. Several cannabinoid 
      tetrad behaviours are altered in the absence of SGIP1. SGIP1(-/-) males exhibit 
      abnormal behaviours on Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol withdrawal. SGIP1 deletion also 
      reduces acute nociception, and SGIP1(-/-) mice are more sensitive to analgesics. 
      CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: SGIP1 was detected as a novel protein associated 
      with CB(1) receptors, and profoundly modified CB(1) receptor signalling. Genetic 
      deletion of SGIP1 particularly affected behavioural tests of mood-related 
      assessment and the cannabinoid tetrad. SGIP1(-/-) mice exhibit decreased 
      nociception and augmented responses to CB(1) receptor agonists and morphine. 
      These in vivo findings suggest that SGIP1 is a novel modulator of CB(1) 
      receptor-mediated behaviour.

TI  - Dual-specificity phosphatase 15 (DUSP15) in the nucleus accumbens is a novel 
      negative regulator of morphine-associated contextual memory.
PG  - e12884
LID - 10.1111/adb.12884 [doi]
AB  - Drug relapse among addicts often occurs due to the learned association between 
      drug-paired cues and the rewarding effects of these drugs, such as morphine. 
      Contextual memory associated with morphine has a central role in maintenance and 
      relapse. We showed that morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) activates 
      extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The 
      main enzymes that mediate ERK dephosphorylation are members of the 
      dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) superfamily. It is unclear which members 
      regulate the morphine CPP-induced activation of ERK. After screening, DUSP15 was 
      found to be decreased during both morphine CPP expression and the reinstatement 
      period. Intra-NAc infusions of AAV-DUSP15 (overexpression) not only prevented the 
      expression of morphine-induced CPP but also facilitated extinction, inhibited 
      reinstatement, and abolished ERK activation. However, after repeated morphine 
      exposure and withdrawal in mice, there was no change in the expression of p-ERK 
      and DUSP15, and the overexpression of DUSP15 in the NAc did not improve the 
      impaired spatial memory or anxiety-like behaviour induced by morphine. Together, 
      these findings indicate that DUSP15 not only prevents the expression of 
      drug-paired contextual memory but also promotes the extinction of existing 
      addiction memories, thus providing a novel therapeutic target for the treatment 
      of drug addiction.

AB  - Neurochemical mechanisms underlying development of drug dependence and withdrawal 
      syndrome remain unclear. Several clinical features of withdrawal syndrome, such 
      as anxiety, are considered to be common among patients with drug dependence 
      induced by different drugs of abuse. In the present study, we investigated 
      whether diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous anxiogenic neuropeptide, 
      participates in the anxiety associated with drug dependence and its withdrawal 
      symptoms. When we examined brain from mice dependent on alcohol, nicotine, and 
      morphine, we observed that the levels of DBI protein and its mRNA significantly 
      increased. Abrupt cessation of these drugs facilitated further increases in DBI 
      expression. In the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice, concomitant 
      administration of specific antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and m-opioid 
      receptors, respectively, abolished the increased expression. Similar patterns of 
      DBI expression were observed in the neurons after sustained exposure to these 
      drugs and its removal from culture medium. Sustained exposure of the neurons to 
      abused drugs significantly increased the KCl (30 mM)-induced 45Ca2+ influx and 
      enhanced expression of alpha1 subunits for L-type high voltage-gated Ca2+ 
      channels (HVCCs). In addition, the increase in DBI expression was completely 
      blocked by L-type HVCC inhibitors. Therefore, these alterations in DBI 
      expression, mediated via increased influx of Ca2+ through upregulated L-type 
      HVCCs, are closely related to drug dependence and/or its withdrawal syndrome and 
      are considered to be part of a common biochemical process in drug dependence 
      induced by different drugs of abuse.

AB  - Coping skills are essential in determining the outcomes of aversive life events. 
      Our research was aimed to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of different 
      coping styles in two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and SWR/J. We compared the 
      influence of a preceding stressor (0.5h of restraint) on behavioral and gene 
      expression profiles between these two strains. The C57BL/6J strain exhibited 
      increased conditioned fear and high immobility (passive coping). Oppositely, the 
      SWR/J mice demonstrated low freezing and immobility, low post-restraint anxiety 
      and considerable struggling during the forced swim test (active coping). Gene 
      profiling in the amygdala revealed transcriptional patterns that were related to 
      the differential stress reactivity, such as the activation of 
      glucocorticoid-dependent genes specifically in the C57BL/6J mice. Post-restraint 
      blood sampling for corticosterone levels confirmed the association of 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation with a passive coping style. 
      Pharmacological tools were used to modulate the stress-coping strategies. The 
      blockade of opioid receptors (ORs) before the aversive event caused 
      transcriptional and neuroendocrine changes in the SWR/J mice that were 
      characteristic of the passive coping strategy. We found that treatment with a 
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist (dexamethasone (DEX), 4mg/kg) impaired the 
      consolidation of fear memory in the C57BL/6J mice and that this effect was 
      reversed by OR blockade (naltrexone (NTX), 2mg/kg). In parallel, a glucocorticoid 
      receptor antagonist (mifepristone (MIF), 20mg/kg) reversed the effect of morphine 
      (20mg/kg) on conditioned fear in the C57BL/6J mice. Our results suggest that in 
      mice, stress-coping strategies are determined by opioid-dependent mechanisms that 
      modulate activity of the HPA axis.

AB  - Genetic reference populations, particularly the BXD recombinant inbred (BXD RI) 
      strains derived from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, are a valuable resource for the 
      discovery of the bio-molecular substrates and genetic drivers responsible for 
      trait variation and covariation. This approach can be profitably applied in the 
      analysis of susceptibility and mechanisms of drug and alcohol use disorders for 
      which many predisposing behaviors may predict the occurrence and manifestation of 
      increased preference for these substances. Many of these traits are modeled by 
      common mouse behavioral assays, facilitating the detection of patterns and 
      sources of genetic coregulation of predisposing phenotypes and substance 
      consumption. Members of the Tennessee Mouse Genome Consortium (TMGC) have 
      obtained phenotype data from over 250 measures related to multiple behavioral 
      assays across several batteries: response to, and withdrawal from cocaine, 
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; "ecstasy" (MDMA), morphine and alcohol; 
      novelty seeking; behavioral despair and related neurological phenomena; pain 
      sensitivity; stress sensitivity; anxiety; hyperactivity and sleep/wake cycles. 
      All traits have been measured in both sexes in approximately 70 strains of the 
      recently expanded panel of BXD RI strains. Sex differences and heritability 
      estimates were obtained for each trait, and a comparison of early (N = 32) and 
      recent (N = 37) BXD RI lines was performed. Primary data are publicly available 
      for heritability, sex difference and genetic analyses using the MouseTrack 
      database, and are also available in GeneNetwork.org for quantitative trait locus 
      (QTL) detection and genetic analysis of gene expression. Together with the 
      results of related studies, these data form a public resource for integrative 
      systems genetic analysis of neurobehavioral traits.

TI  - The staircase test in mice: a simple and efficient procedure for primary 
      screening of anxiolytic agents.
PG  - 48-53
AB  - The staircase test consists of placing a naive mouse in an enclosed staircase 
      with five steps and observing the number of steps climbed and rearings made in a 
      3-min period. All the clinically active anxiolytics tested (chlordiazepoxide, 
      clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, meprobamate, phenobarbital) reduce rearing at 
      doses which did not reduce the number of steps climbed. The majority of 
      non-anxiolytic substances tested (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, imipramine, 
      amitriptyline, amphetamine, morphine and carbamazepine) produced a parallel 
      reduction of both behavioural variables. Ethosuximide had no effect on behaviour. 
      The anticonvulsant sodium valproate produced an anxiolytic profile in this test, 
      since it reduced rearing, while increasing step climbing. This result confirms 
      the anxiolytic properties of valproate observed in other behavioural models. Our 
      results indicate that the staircase test in mice is simple, rapid and selective 
      for anxiolytics. The test is well suited for use as a primary screening method.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mexico is considered an ancestral center of 
      diversity of Salvia species, however many of them lack scientific information. 
      Salvia circinnata Cav. (syn. Salvia amarissima Ortega) is an endemic species used 
      in traditional medicine to treat disorders attributed to a cold state like 
      anxiety in the central nervous system, as well as gastrointestinal ailments and 
      pain relief. AIM OF THE STUDY: To give preclinical evidence about the 
      pharmacological properties of this species by investigating its antinociceptive 
      and anti-inflammatory effects, the chemical nature of at least one metabolite, 
      and a possible mechanism of action and adverse effects, using different 
      experimental models of pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different crude extracts of 
      Salvia circinnata Cav. aerial parts were prepared using increasing polarity and 
      evaluated in the formalin test in mice. This screening allowed to select and 
      evaluate an ethyl acetate extract (EtOAc), as the most bioactive extract, and a 
      metabolite. Antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities were confirmed using 
      the plantar test and carrageenan-induced edema. The antinociceptive effects of 
      the extracts were compared to that observed with morphine (1 mg/kg), tramadol 
      (20 mg/kg) or indomethacin (20 mg/kg) as reference drugs. Participation of 
      opioids and TRPV1 receptors was investigated, as well as acute toxicity and 
      adverse effects of sedation and gastric damage. RESULTS: EtOAc (0.1-10 mg/kg) of 
      S. circinnata Cav. showed a dose-dependent and significant antinociceptive 
      activity, associated in part with the presence of a neo-clerodane glycoside 
      amarisolide A (0.01-1 mg/kg), in the neurogenic and inflammatory phases of the 
      formalin test. Central action of both treatments was corroborated in the plantar 
      test, whereas anti-inflammatory effects were confirmed with the extract (1 and 
      10 mg/kg) and amarisolide A (1 mg/kg) in the carrageenan-induced edema test. An 
      opioid mechanism in both treatments, and the TRPV1 receptor modulation in the 
      extract were involved. No acute toxicity and adverse effects were noticed with 
      the extract and pure compound in comparison to the reference drugs. CONCLUSION: 
      These results provide preclinical evidence of the ethnopharmacological 
      antinociceptive S. circinnata Cav. properties, in which the neo-clerodane 
      diterpene glycoside amarisolide A was partially responsible involving the 
      participation of the opioid receptors, while TRPV1 receptor modulation was 
      implicated in the anti-inflammatory activity may be because of the presence of 
      other constituents. This information supports the use of this species in folk 
      medicine for pain therapy.

AB  - Exposure to prenatal stress (PS) leads to the offspring's vulnerability towards 
      the development of cognitive and behavioral disorders. Laterodorsal tegmentum 
      (LDT) is a part of the brainstem cholinergic system that is believed to play a 
      pivotal role in the stress-associated progression of anxiety, memory impairment, 
      and addictive behaviors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the 
      electrophysiological alterations of LDT cholinergic neurons and its accompanied 
      behavioral and cognitive outcomes in the offspring of mice exposed to physical or 
      psychological PS. Swiss Webster mice were exposed to physical or psychological 
      stress on the tenth day of gestation. Ex vivo investigations in LDT brain slices 
      of adolescent male offspring were performed to evaluate the effects of two 
      stressor types on the activity of cholinergic neurons. Open field test, elevated 
      plus maze, passive avoidance test, and conditioned place preference were 
      conducted to assess behavioral and cognitive alterations in the offspring. The 
      offspring of both physical and psychological PS-exposed mice exhibited increased 
      locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, memory impairment, and preference to 
      morphine. In both early- and late-firing cholinergic neurons of the LDT, stressed 
      groups demonstrated higher firing frequency, lower adaptation ratio, decreased 
      action potential threshold, and therefore increased excitability compared to the 
      control group. The findings of the present study suggest that the 
      hyperexcitability of the cholinergic neurons of LDT might be involved in the 
      development of PS-associated anxiety-like behaviors, drug seeking, and memory 
      impairment.

AB  - Previous studies have attributed the prominent analgesic, hallucinogenic, 
      sedative, and anxiolytic properties of Salvia divinorum to Salvinorin A. However, 
      the overall pharmacological profile of this isolate limits its clinical 
      applications. To address these limitations, our study evaluates the 
      C(22)-fused-heteroaromatic analogue of salvinorin A [2-O-salvinorin B 
      benzofuran-2-carboxylate] (P-3l) in mice nociception and anxiety models while 
      assessing possible mechanism of action. In comparison with the control group, 
      orally administered P-3l (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) attenuates acetic acid-induced 
      abdominal writhing, formalin-induced hind paw licking, the thermal reaction to 
      the hotplate, and/or aversive response in the elevated plus-maze, open field, and 
      light-dark box; and potentiates the effect of morphine and diazepam at 
      sub-effective doses (1.25 and 0.25 mg/kg, respectively) without eliciting 
      significant alterations in relative organ weight, or haematological or 
      biochemical parameters. The in vivo blockade of P-3 l effects by naloxone 
      (non-selective opioid receptor antagonist), naloxonazine (antagonist of specific 
      subtypes mu(1) of μ-OR), and nor-binaltorphimine (selective ĸ-OR antagonist) 
      supports initial results from binding assays and the interpretations made 
      possible from computational modeling of the interactions of P-3 l with the opioid 
      receptor subtypes. In addition to the opioidergic mechanism, the blockade of the 
      P-3 l effect by flumazenil suggests benzodiazepine binding site involvement in 
      its biological activities. These results support P-3 l potentially possessing 
      clinical utility and substantiate the need for additional pharmacological 
      characterization.

TI  - Effects of Tyr-MIF-1 on stress-induced analgesia and the blockade of development 
      of morphine tolerance by stress in mice.
PG  - 231-5
AB  - The role of Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) in biological responses to stress 
      exposure was examined in mice. Intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular 
      administration of Tyr-MIF-1 attenuated not only footshock (FS)- and forced 
      swimming (SW)-stress-induced analgesia (SIA) but also socio-psychological 
      (PSY)-SIA that, when using the communication box, is produced without any direct 
      physical nociceptions. Tyr-MIF-1 also disrupted the suppressive effect of 
      concurrent exposure to FS- and PSY-stress on the development of morphine 
      antinociceptive tolerance. In elevated-plus-maze tests, mice treated with 
      Tyr-MIF-1 tended to spend more time in the open arms compared with the control 
      group, suggesting the anxiolytic properties of the peptide. Thus, the finding 
      that Tyr-MIF-1 modulates these stress responses suggests that the peptide 
      regulates an endogenous biological alert system responding to stress exposure, 
      perhaps, counteracting the excessive response of the system. Furthermore, 
      Tyr-MIF-1, in the case of PSY-stress, through the attenuation of emotional 
      factors such as fear and anxiety, may suppress PSY-SIA and inhibition by 
      PSY-stress of the development of morphine tolerance.

TI  - Targeted deletion of the mouse α2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene 
      (Chrna2) potentiates nicotine-modulated behaviors.
PG  - 7728-41
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4731-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - Baseline and nicotine-modulated behaviors were assessed in mice harboring a null 
      mutant allele of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit gene α2 
      (Chrna2). Homozygous Chrna2(-/-) mice are viable, show expected sex and Mendelian 
      genotype ratios, and exhibit no gross neuroanatomical abnormalities. A broad 
      range of behavioral tests designed to assess genotype-dependent effects on 
      anxiety (elevated plus maze and light/dark box), motor coordination (narrow bean 
      traverse and gait), and locomotor activity revealed no significant differences 
      between mutant mice and age-matched wild-type littermates. Furthermore, a panel 
      of tests measuring traits, such as body position, spontaneous activity, 
      respiration, tremors, body tone, and startle response, revealed normal responses 
      for Chrna2-null mutant mice. However, Chrna2(-/-) mice do exhibit a mild motor or 
      coordination phenotype (a decreased latency to fall during the accelerating 
      rotarod test) and possess an increased sensitivity to nicotine-induced analgesia 
      in the hotplate assay. Relative to wild-type, Chrna2(-/-) mice show potentiated 
      nicotine self-administration and withdrawal behaviors and exhibit a sex-dependent 
      enhancement of nicotine-facilitated cued, but not trace or contextual, fear 
      conditioning. Overall, our results suggest that loss of the mouse nAChR α2 
      subunit has very limited effects on baseline behavior but does lead to the 
      potentiation of several nicotine-modulated behaviors.

AB  - Social isolation stress (SIS) as a type of chronic stress could induce 
      depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Our study evaluates the role of opioid 
      system on negative behavioral impacts of SIS in male NMRI mice. We investigated 
      effects of morphine, a nonselective opioid receptor (OR) agonist, naltrexone 
      (NLX), an OR antagonist, naltrindole (NLT), a delta opioid receptor (DOR) 
      antagonist, SNC80, a DOR agonist, U-69593, a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist, 
      nor-Binaltorphimine, a selective KOR antagonist and cyprodime hydrochloride a 
      selective mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist on depressive- and anxiety-like 
      behaviors. Using RT-PCR we evaluated ORs gene expression in mice brain. Our 
      findings showed that SIS induced anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in the 
      forced swimming test, open field test, splash test and hole-board test. Moreover, 
      administration of SNC-80 significantly mitigated anxiety- and depressive-like 
      behaviors. NLT decreased grooming-activity in the splash test. Excitingly, 
      administration of agents affecting KOR failed to alter the negative effects of 
      SIS. RT-PCR demonstrated that MOR and KOR gene expression decreased in socially 
      isolated mice; however, SIS did not affect DORs expression. Our findings suggest 
      that SIS at least in part, probably via altering endogenous opioids particularly 
      MORs and KORs but not DORs mediated negative impacts on behavior; also, it could 
      be concluded that DORs might be considered as a novel target for studying 
      depression and anxiety.

TI  - Who is HOT and who is LOT? Detailed characterization of prescription 
      opioid-induced changes in behavior between 129P3/J and 129S1/SvlmJ mouse 
      substrains.
PG  - e12609

AB  - Genetic factors are theorized to contribute to the substantial inter-individual 
      variability in opioid abuse/addiction. To advance the behavioral genetics of 
      prescription opioid abuse, our prior work identified the 129S1/SvlmJ (S1) and 
      related 129P3/J (P3) mouse substrains, respectively, as low and high 
      opioid-taking. Herein, we related our prior results to measures of sucrose 
      reward/reinforcement, basal anxiety, opioid-induced place-conditioning, locomotor 
      activity and Straub tail reaction, as well as behavioral and physiological signs 
      of withdrawal. Substrains were also re-examined for higher-dose oxycodone and 
      fentanyl intake under limited-access drinking procedures. S1 mice failed to 
      acquire sucrose self-administration under various operant-conditioning procedures 
      and exhibited lower sucrose intake in the home-cage. However, sucrose intake 
      under limited-access procedures escalated in both substrains with repeated 
      sucrose experience. S1 mice exhibited less spontaneous locomotor activity, as 
      well as less opioid-induced locomotor activity and Straub tail reaction, than P3 
      mice and failed to exhibit an oxycodone-induced place-preference. The lack of 
      conditioned behavior by S1 mice was unrelated to behavioral signs of 
      withdrawal-induced negative affect or dependence severity, but might reflect high 
      levels of basal anxiety-like behavior. Intriguingly, S1 and P3 mice initially 
      exhibited equivalent oxycodone and fentanyl consumption in the home-cage; however 
      opioid intake escalated only in P3 mice with repeated opioid experience. No sex 
      differences were observed for any of our measures. These data provide additional 
      evidence for robust differences in opioid addiction-related behaviors between P3 
      and S1 substrains and suggest that anxiety, learning, and/or motivational 
      impairments might confound interpretation of operant- and place-conditioning 
      studies employing the S1 substrain.

TI  - Identification and characterization of novel mammalian neuropeptide FF-like 
      peptides that attenuate morphine-induced antinociception.
PG  - 36961-9
AB  - The two mammalian neuropeptides NPFF and NPAF have been shown to have important 
      roles in nociception, anxiety, learning and memory, and cardiovascular reflex. 
      Two receptors (FF1 and FF2) have been molecularly identified for NPFF and NPAF. 
      We have now characterized a novel gene designated NPVF that encodes two 
      neuropeptides highly similar to NPFF. NPVF mRNA was detected specifically in a 
      region between the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei. NPVF-derived 
      peptides displayed higher affinity for FF1 than NPFF-derived peptides, but showed 
      poor agonist activity for FF2. Following intracerebral ventricular 
      administration, a NPVF-derived peptide blocked morphine-induced analgesia more 
      potently than NPFF in both acute and inflammatory models of pain. In situ 
      hybridization analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of FF1 and FF2 in 
      the rat central nervous system. FF1 was broadly distributed, with the highest 
      levels found in specific regions of the limbic system and the brainstem where 
      NPVF-producing neurons were shown to project. FF2, in contrast, was mostly 
      expressed in the spinal cord and some regions of the thalamus. These results 
      indicate that the endogenous ligands for FF1 and FF2 are NPVF- and NPFF-derived 
      peptides, respectively, and suggest that the NPVF/FF1 system may be an important 
      part of endogenous anti-opioid mechanism.

TI  - In situ hybridization analysis of RGS mRNA regulation and behavioral phenotyping 
      of RGS mutant mice.
PG  - 205-29
AB  - To elucidate the functional role of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) in 
      vivo, it will be critical to (i) determine how RGS activity is altered in 
      response to a variety of manipulations and (ii) observe how the system is changed 
      when RGS protein function is altered genetically. To facilitate studies of 
      dynamic regulation of RGS protein activity, this article describes detailed 
      methods for radioisotopic in situ hybridization for semiquantitative analyses of 
      RGS mRNA abundances. Toward characterizing the functional differences in mice 
      with genetically altered RGS activities, this article describes a subset of 
      behavioral tests suitable for assaying sensitivities to drugs of abuse. These 
      protocols should provide valuable guidance for investigators to establish these 
      methodologies independently in their own laboratories and, over time, increase 
      our understanding of RGS function in vivo.

AB  - Two-pore domain K(+) (K(2P)) channels are thought to underlie background K(+) 
      conductance in many cell types. The Trek subfamily of K(2P) channels consists of 
      three members, Trek1/Kcnk2, Trek2/Kcnk10, and Traak/Kcnk4, all three of which are 
      expressed in the rodent CNS. Constitutive ablation of the Trek1 gene in mice 
      correlates with enhanced sensitivity to ischemia and epilepsy, decreased 
      sensitivity to the effects of inhaled anesthetics, increased sensitivity to 
      thermal and mechanical pain, and resistance to depression. While the distribution 
      of Trek2 mRNA in the CNS is broad, little is known about the relevance of this 
      Trek family member to neurobiology and behavior. Here, we probed the effect of 
      constitutive Trek2 ablation, as well as the simultaneous constitutive ablation of 
      all three Trek family genes, in paradigms that assess motor activity, 
      coordination, anxiety-related behavior, learning and memory, and drug-induced 
      reward-related behavior. No differences were observed between Trek2(-/-) and 
      Trek1/2/Traak(-/-) mice in coordination or total distance traveled in an 
      open-field. A gender-dependent impact of Trek ablation on open-field 
      anxiety-related behavior was observed, as female but not male Trek2(-/-) and 
      Trek1/2/Traak(-/-) mice spent more time in, and made a greater number of entries 
      into, the center of the open-field than wild-type counterparts. Further 
      evaluation of anxiety-related behavior in the elevated plus maze and light/dark 
      box, however, did not reveal a significant influence of genotype on performance 
      for either gender. Furthermore, Trek(-/-) mice behaved normally in tests of 
      learning and memory, including contextual fear conditioning and novel object 
      recognition, and with respect to opioid-induced motor stimulation and conditioned 
      place preference (CPP). Collectively, these data argue that despite their broad 
      distribution in the CNS, Trek channels exert a minimal influence on a wide-range 
      of behaviors.

AB  - Noribogaine is the long-lived human metabolite of the anti-addictive substance 
      ibogaine. Noribogaine efficaciously reaches the brain with concentrations up to 
      20 μM after acute therapeutic dose of 40 mg/kg ibogaine in animals. Noribogaine 
      displays atypical opioid-like components in vivo, anti-addictive effects and 
      potent modulatory properties of the tolerance to opiates for which the mode of 
      action remained uncharacterized thus far. Our binding experiments and 
      computational simulations indicate that noribogaine may bind to the orthosteric 
      morphinan binding site of the opioid receptors. Functional activities of 
      noribogaine at G-protein and non G-protein pathways of the mu and kappa opioid 
      receptors were characterized. Noribogaine was a weak mu antagonist with a 
      functional inhibition constants (Ke) of 20 μM at the G-protein and β-arrestin 
      signaling pathways. Conversely, noribogaine was a G-protein biased kappa agonist 
      75% as efficacious as dynorphin A at stimulating GDP-GTP exchange (EC50=9 μM) but 
      only 12% as efficacious at recruiting β-arrestin, which could contribute to the 
      lack of dysphoric effects of noribogaine. In turn, noribogaine functionally 
      inhibited dynorphin-induced kappa β-arrestin recruitment and was more potent than 
      its G-protein agonistic activity with an IC50 of 1 μM. This biased 
      agonist/antagonist pharmacology is unique to noribogaine in comparison to various 
      other ligands including ibogaine, 18-MC, nalmefene, and 6'-GNTI. We predict 
      noribogaine to promote certain analgesic effects as well as anti-addictive 
      effects at effective concentrations>1 μM in the brain. Because elevated levels of 
      dynorphins are commonly observed and correlated with anxiety, dysphoric effects, 
      and decreased dopaminergic tone, a therapeutically relevant functional inhibition 
      bias to endogenously released dynorphins by noribogaine might be worthy of 
      consideration for treating anxiety and substance related disorders.

TI  - Decoy peptide targeted to Toll-IL-1R domain inhibits LPS and TLR4-active 
      metabolite morphine-3 glucuronide sensitization of sensory neurons.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling adapter 
      protein interactions with Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) domains present in 
      sensory neurons may modulate neuropathic pain states. Following ligand 
      interaction with TLRs, TIR serves to both initiate intracellular signaling and 
      facilitate recruitment of signaling adapter proteins to the intracytoplasmic 
      domain. Although TLR TIR is central to a number of TLR signaling cascades, its 
      role in sensory neurons is poorly understood. In this study we investigated the 
      degree to which TLR TIR decoy peptide modified to include a TAT sequence 
      (Trans-Activator of Transcription gene in HIV; TAT-4BB) affected LPS-induced 
      intracellular calcium flux and excitation in sensory neurons, and behavioral 
      changes due to TLR4 active metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) exposure in 
      vivo. TAT-4BB inhibited LPS-induced calcium changes in a majority of sensory 
      neurons and decreased LPS-dependent neuronal excitability in small diameter 
      neurons. Acute systemic administration of the TAT-4BB reversed M3G-induced 
      tactile allodynia in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect motor activity, 
      anxiety or responses to noxious thermal stimulus. These data suggest that 
      targeting TLR TIR domains may provide novel pharmacological targets to reduce or 
      reverse TLR4-dependent pain behavior in the rodent.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat Protein Promotes Neuroendocrine Dysfunction Concurrent with the 
      Potentiation of Oxycodone's Psychomotor Effects in Female Mice.
LID - 10.3390/v13050813 [doi]
LID - 813
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with neuroendocrine dysfunction 
      which may contribute to co-morbid stress-sensitive disorders. The 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) or -gonadal (HPG) axes are perturbed in up 
      to 50% of HIV patients. The mechanisms are not known, but we have found the HIV-1 
      trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein to recapitulate the clinical 
      phenotype in male mice. We hypothesized that HPA and/or HPG dysregulation 
      contributes to Tat-mediated interactions with oxycodone, an opioid often 
      prescribed to HIV patients, in females. Female mice that conditionally-expressed 
      the Tat(1-86) protein [Tat(+) mice] or their counterparts that did not [Tat(-) 
      control mice] were exposed to forced swim stress (or not) and 
      behaviorally-assessed for motor and anxiety-like behavior. Some mice had 
      glucocorticoid receptors (GR) or corticotropin-releasing factor receptors (CRF-R) 
      pharmacologically inhibited. Some mice were ovariectomized (OVX). As seen 
      previously in males, Tat elevated basal corticosterone levels and potentiated 
      oxycodone's psychomotor activity in females. Unlike males, females did not 
      demonstrate adrenal insufficiency and oxycodone potentiation was not regulated by 
      GRs or CRF-Rs. Rather OVX attenuated Tat/oxycodone interactions. Either Tat or 
      oxycodone increased anxiety-like behavior and their combination increased 
      hypothalamic allopregnanolone. OVX increased basal hypothalamic allopregnanolone 
      and obviated Tat or oxycodone-mediated fluctuations. Together, these data provide 
      further evidence for Tat-mediated dysregulation of the HPA axis and reveal the 
      importance of HPG axis regulation in females. HPA/HPG disruption may contribute 
      vulnerability to affective and substance use disorders.

TI  - The Hypnotic, Anxiolytic, and Antinociceptive Profile of a Novel µ-Opioid 
      Agonist.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22050800 [doi]
LID - 800
AB  - 5'-4-Alkyl/aryl-1H-1,2,3-triazole derivatives PILAB 1-12 were synthesized and a 
      pharmacological screening of these derivatives was performed to identify a 
      possible effect on the Central Nervous System (CNS) and to explore the associated 
      mechanisms of action. The mice received a peritoneal injection (100 µmol/kg) of 
      each of the 12 PILAB derivatives 10 min prior to the injection of pentobarbital 
      and the mean hypnosis times were recorded. The mean hypnosis time increased for 
      the mice treated with PILAB 8, which was prevented when mice were administered 
      CTOP, a µ-opioid antagonist. Locomotor and motor activities were not affected by 
      PILAB 8. The anxiolytic effect of PILAB 8 was evaluated next in an elevated-plus 
      maze apparatus. PILAB 8 and midazolam increased a percentage of entries and spent 
      time in the open arms of the apparatus compared with the control group. 
      Conversely, a decrease in the percentages of entries and time spent in the closed 
      arms were observed. Pretreatment with naloxone, a non-specific opioid antagonist, 
      prior to administration of PILAB 8 exhibited a reverted anxiolytic effect. PILAB 
      8 exhibited antinociceptive activity in the hot plate test, and reduced 
      reactivity to formalin in the neurogenic and the inflammatory phases. These data 
      suggest that PILAB 8 can activate µ-opioid receptors to provoke antinociceptive 
      and anti-inflammatory effects in mice.

AB  - Opioid addiction and the opioid overdose epidemic are becoming more serious, and 
      the development of therapeutic agents is essential for the pharmacological 
      treatment of substance use disorders. The κ-opioid receptor (KOP) is a member of 
      the opioid receptor system that has been gaining attention as a promising 
      molecular target for the treatment of numerous human disorders, including pain, 
      depression, anxiety, and drug addiction. Here, we biologically and 
      pharmacologically evaluated a novel azepane-derived ligand, NP-5497-KA, as a 
      selective KOP agonist. NP-5497-KA had 1000-fold higher selectivity for the KOP 
      over the μ-opioid receptor (MOP), which was higher than nalfurafine (KOP/MOP: 
      65-fold), and acted as a selective KOP full agonist in the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine 
      monophosphate assay. The oral administration of NP-5497-KA (1-10 mg/kg) 
      dose-dependently suppressed morphine-induced conditioned place preference in 
      C57BL/6 J mice, and its effects were comparable to an intraperitoneal injection 
      of nalfurafine (1-10 μg/kg). Nalfurafine (10 μg/kg) significantly inhibited 
      rotarod performance, whereas NP-5497-KA (10 mg/kg) exerted no effect on rotarod 
      performance. These results indicate that NP-5497-KA may be a novel option for the 
      treatment of opioid use disorder with fewer side effects.

      a possible biochemical alteration common to drug dependence.
PG  - 1215-22
AB  - Mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and expression of withdrawal syndrome 
      have not fully clarified despite of huge accumulation of experimental and 
      clinical data at present. Several clinical features of withdrawal syndrome are 
      considered to be common among patients with drug dependence induced by different 
      drugs of abuse. One of them is anxiety. Recent investigations have revealed that 
      diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a peptide consisting of 87 amino acids with 
      molecular weight of about 10 kDa, serves as an inverse agonist for benzodiazepine 
      (BZD) receptors with endogenously anxiogenic potential. These lines of data 
      suggest that cerebral DBI expression in brain may participates in formation of 
      drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome. Based on this working 
      hypothesis, we have examined DBI expression in the brain derived from mice 
      depended on alcohol (ethanol), nicotine, and morphine to investigate functional 
      relationship between cerebral DBI expression and drug dependence. Cerebral DBI 
      expression significantly increases in animals with drug dependence induced by 
      these drugs, and in the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice 
      concomitant administration of antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and opioid 
      receptors, respectively, abolished the increase. Abrupt cessation of 
      administration of drugs facilitated further increase in DBI expression. 
      Therefore, these alterations in DBI expression have close relationship with 
      formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome, and are 
      considered to be a common biochemical process in drug dependence induced by 
      different drugs of abuse. Finding and elucidation of mechanisms for common 
      biochemical alterations among drug dependence may provide a clue to clarify 
      mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal 
      syndrome.

AB  - We have recently demonstrated that allyphenyline, behaving as 
      α2C-adrenoceptor/serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist and α2A-adrenoceptor 
      antagonist, in mice enhanced morphine analgesia, attenuated morphine withdrawal 
      symptoms, showed significant antidepressant-like activity and was devoid of 
      sedative side effects. Opioid and alcohol withdrawal shares several common 
      neurobiological and molecular mechanisms. Therefore, in this study we expanded 
      our analysis of the pharmacological properties of allyphenyline by investigating 
      its ability to prevent the expression of somatic withdrawal signs, anxiety-like 
      behavior and hyperlocomotion associated with chronic ethanol intoxication. Rats 
      were subjected to induction of ethanol dependence via repeated daily intragastric 
      ethanol (20%) administration for 4 consecutive days. Twelve hours after the last 
      alcohol administration, somatic alcohol withdrawal signs were scored. Results 
      revealed a significant expression of physical withdrawal signs that were not 
      affected by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of allyphenyline at the doses 
      of 0.05, 0.275 and 0.5 mg/kg. In contrast, allyphenyline (0.05 and 0.275 mg/kg 
      i.p.) significantly reduced hyperanxiety-like behavior observed 6 days after 
      alcohol intoxication as measured using the defensive burying test. Allyphenyline 
      also reduced open field hyperlocomotor activity associated with alcohol 
      withdrawal. Notably, the anxiolytic effect of the compound, as well as the 
      already reported antidepressant action, was observed at very low doses, 
      suggesting the involvement of its α2C-adrenoceptor/serotonin 5-HT1A receptor 
      agonism. Therefore, the present investigation suggests that allyphenyline might 
      represent an interesting pharmacological tool to investigate the potential of 
      compounds exhibiting α2C-adrenoceptor/serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonism and 
      α2A-adrenoceptor antagonism in the treatment of hyperanxiety and hyperlocomotion 
      occurring during alcohol withdrawal in dependent subjects.

TI  - Microglia disrupt mesolimbic reward circuitry in chronic pain.
PG  - 8442-50
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4036-14.2015 [doi]
AB  - Chronic pain attenuates midbrain dopamine (DA) transmission, as evidenced by a 
      decrease in opioid-evoked DA release in the ventral striatum, suggesting that the 
      occurrence of chronic pain impairs reward-related behaviors. However, mechanisms 
      by which pain modifies DA transmission remain elusive. Using in vivo 
      microdialysis and microinjection of drugs into the mesolimbic DA system, we 
      demonstrate in mice and rats that microglial activation in the VTA compromises 
      not only opioid-evoked release of DA, but also other DA-stimulating drugs, such 
      as cocaine. Our data show that loss of stimulated extracellular DA is due to 
      impaired chloride homeostasis in midbrain GABAergic interneurons. Treatment with 
      minocycline or interfering with BDNF signaling restored chloride transport within 
      these neurons and recovered DA-dependent reward behavior. Our findings 
      demonstrate that a peripheral nerve injury causes activated microglia within 
      reward circuitry that result in disruption of dopaminergic signaling and reward 
      behavior. These results have broad implications that are not restricted to the 
      problem of pain, but are also relevant to affective disorders associated with 
      disruption of reward circuitry. Because chronic pain causes glial activation in 
      areas of the CNS important for mood and affect, our findings may translate to 
      other disorders, including anxiety and depression, that demonstrate high 
      comorbidity with chronic pain.

TI  - Suppression of alcohol-cessation-oriented hyper-anxiety by the benzoflavone 
      moiety of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus in mice.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - A benzoflavone moiety has been reported recently to be responsible for the 
      multifarious CNS effects of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus. In the light of the 
      established usefulness of the benzoflavone moiety in counteracting the withdrawal 
      effects of substances like morphine, cannabinoids and nicotine by the authors, 
      the bioactive benzoflavone moiety (BZF) has been tested in mice treated with an 
      addictive dose (2 g/kg, bid for 6 days) of ethyl alcohol, in order to evaluate 
      its effectiveness in countering alcohol dependence. In a 7-day regimen, different 
      groups of mice were administered vehicle, alcohol and alcohol+three doses (10, 20 
      and 50 mg/kg of the benzoflavone moiety) of P. incarnata; all treatments 
      (chronic) being administered orally, twice daily for 6 days. Similarly, three 
      other groups of mice were rendered addicts upon alcohol by administration of the 
      addictive dose (2 g/kg, bid for 6 days) of ethyl alcohol, and a single acute 
      administration of 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg dose of benzoflavone moiety was given on 
      the 7th day. In both, chronic and acute administrations, the benzoflavone moiety 
      prevented significantly the expression of withdrawal effects of alcohol as there 
      was a significant decrease in anxiety oriented behavior in mice that received 
      benzoflavone moiety of P. incarnata. The chronic administration of P. incarnata 
      with alcohol had better preventive effects than the single acute treatment with 
      P. incarnata in alcohol-dependent mice.

TI  - Automated evaluation of sensitivity to foot shock in mice: inbred strain 
      differences and pharmacological validation.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Assessing foot shock sensitivity in rodents can be useful in identifying 
      analgesic or hyperalgesic drugs, and phenotyping inbred or genetically altered 
      mice. Furthermore, as foot shock is an integral part of several rodent behavioral 
      models, sensitivity should also be assessed to accurately interpret behavioral 
      measures from these models. To eliminate variability and increase the efficiency 
      of manually scored shock sensitivity paradigms, we utilized a startle reflex 
      system to automatically quantify responses to varying levels of foot shock. Eight 
      inbred mouse strains were tested for reactivity to foot shock in this system, as 
      well as inherent startle response activity to loud noise bursts. Strain rank 
      order for shock reactivity differed from that for acoustic startle, suggesting 
      that pathways activated in response to each differed. Analgesic doses of morphine 
      and acetaminophen specifically reduced foot shock responses without affecting 
      motor reflexive responses to loud noises in each strain tested. We also tested 
      diazepam and scopolamine, which are often used to disrupt behavior in 
      shock-related paradigms to illustrate the usefulness of this assay. Overall, 
      these results demonstrate that our automated method is a quick and simple way to 
      accurately assess potential foot shock sensitivity differences owing to strain, 
      genotype or drug treatments.

TI  - [Somatostatin interneurons of prelimbic cortex in regulating morphine-induced 
      behavior changes].
PG  - 463-473
AB  - Drug addiction is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by compulsive drug 
      taking, and involves neuronal plasticity changes in multiple brain regions. The 
      prelimbic cortex (PrL) is a key region of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and 
      contains majority of pyramidal neurons. The excitatory projections from PrL play 
      a very important role in the drug seeking behaviors. PrL also contains a small 
      amount of GABAergic interneurons, which regulate the information integration and 
      transmission of the pyramidal neurons. However, the roles of the GABAergic 
      interneurons in PrL in drug-induced behavior changes are not clear. In the PrL, 
      parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons are two major GABAergic 
      interneurons, which have been reported to regulate the activity of glutamatergic 
      input, and form inhibitory synaptic transmission to regulate the output of 
      downstream signals. Here, we used PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice combined with chemical 
      genetics to explore the role of PV and SST interneurons in PrL in 
      morphine-induced behavior changes. Our data showed that specific inhibiting SST 
      interneurons in PrL significantly increased the anxiety level and decreased 
      morphine-induced locomotor activity and the conditioned place preference (CPP) 
      score. Instead, specific inhibiting PV interneurons in PrL had no effect on the 
      anxiety level, morphine induced-locomotor activity and CPP. Our findings provide 
      a new insight into the cellular and neuronal specific mechanism for drug 
      addiction.

TI  - Effects of chronic fentanyl administration on behavioral characteristics of mice.
PG  - 17-35
LID - 10.1002/npr2.12040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid categorized as a narcotic analgesic, has 
      a 100- to 200-fold stronger effect than most opioids, such as morphine. Fatal 
      accidents due to chronic use and abuse of fentanyl are a worldwide social 
      problem. One reason for the abuse of fentanyl is its psychostimulant effects that 
      could induce behavioral changes. The effects of chronic fentanyl administration 
      on behavior, however, are unclear. METHODS: Adult male C57BL/6J mice were 
      chronically administered fentanyl (0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg/d i.p.), and various 
      behaviors were assessed using a behavioral test battery. RESULTS: Mice 
      chronically administered a high dose of fentanyl (0.3 mg/kg/d) exhibited 
      decreased anxiety-like behavior as assessed by the open field and elevated plus 
      maze tests. On the other hand, interruption of fentanyl administration led to 
      increased anxiety-like behavior as observed in the light and dark transition 
      test. The hot plate test revealed that chronic administration of fentanyl reduced 
      pain sensitivity. High-dose chronic fentanyl administration reduced the locomotor 
      stimulatory effects of cocaine. The results, however, failed to reach the 
      threshold for study-wide statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Chronic fentanyl 
      administration induces some behavioral changes in mice. Although further studies 
      are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of the behavioral effects of 
      chronic fentanyl administration, our findings suggest that fentanyl is safe under 
      properly controlled conditions.

TI  - Chronic opioid pretreatment potentiates the sensitization of fear learning by 
      trauma.
PG  - 482-490
LID - 10.1038/s41386-019-0559-5 [doi]
AB  - Despite the large comorbidity between PTSD and opioid use disorders, as well as 
      the common treatment of physical injuries resulting from trauma with opioids, the 
      ability of opioid treatments to subsequently modify PTSD-related behavior has not 
      been well studied. Using the stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) model for PTSD, 
      we characterized the impact of chronic opioid regimens on the sensitization of 
      fear learning seen following traumatic stress in mice. We demonstrate for the 
      first time that chronic opioid pretreatment is able to robustly augment 
      associative fear learning. Highlighting aversive learning as the cognitive 
      process mediating this behavioral outcome, these changes were observed after a 
      considerable period of drug cessation, generalized to learning about multiple 
      aversive stimuli, were not due to changes in stimulus sensitivity or basal 
      anxiety, and correlated with a marker of synaptic plasticity within the 
      basolateral amygdala. Additionally, these changes were not observed when opioids 
      were given after the traumatic event. Moreover, we found that neither reducing 
      the frequency of opioid administration nor bidirectional manipulation of acute 
      withdrawal impacted the subsequent enhancement in fear learning seen. Given the 
      fundamental role of associative fear learning in the generation and progression 
      of PTSD, these findings are of direct translational relevance to the comorbidity 
      between opioid dependence and PTSD, and they are also pertinent to the use of 
      opioids for treating pain resulting from traumas involving physical injuries.

AB  - Flunitrazepam in a dose range of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg i.v. produced dose dependent 
      sedation and muscle relaxation, while even 1 mg/kg of flunitrazepam had no 
      anesthetic effect (loss of righting reflex). Flunitrazepam in a dose over 0.01 
      mg/kg prolonged anesthesia induced by pentobarbital, thiopental and ketamine in 
      mice and rats and combinations of non-effective doses of these anesthetics with 
      flunitrazepam induced anesthesia in mice. Furthermore, flunitrazepam enhanced 
      gaseous anesthesia in mice and rats. Flunitrazepam alone was slightly effective 
      in prevention of acetic acid writhing in mice and the drug enhanced the 
      anti-writhing effects of morphine, pentazocine and thalamonal. Flunitrazepam 
      alone had little analgesic effect on the hot plate test in mice, while it did 
      enhance the effect of morphine. The analgesic effects of morphine and pentazocine 
      on the tail pinch test in rats were potentiated with 0.1 and 1 mg/kg of 
      flunitrazepam. Flunitrazepam had no effect on bradykinin-induced nociceptive 
      response in rats, while 1 mg/kg of the drug enhanced morphine analgesia in this 
      test. Combined effect of flunitrazepam on activities of anesthetics and 
      analgesics may contribute to the clinical effect of this drug in cases of 
      preanesthetic medication.

TI  - Dietary Supplementation with Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Reduces 
      Opioid-Seeking Behaviors and Alters the Gut Microbiome.
LID - 10.3390/nu11081900 [doi]
LID - 1900
AB  - Opioids are highly addictive substances with a relapse rate of over 90%. While 
      preclinical models of chronic opioid exposure exist for studying opioid 
      dependence, none recapitulate the relapses observed in human opioid addiction. 
      The mechanisms associated with opioid dependence, the accompanying withdrawal 
      symptoms, and the relapses that are often observed months or years after opioid 
      dependence are poorly understood. Therefore, we developed a novel model of 
      chronic opioid exposure whereby the level of administration is self-directed with 
      periods of behavior acquisition, maintenance, and then extinction alternating 
      with reinstatement. This profile arguably mirrors that seen in humans, with 
      initial opioid use followed by alternating periods of abstinence and relapse. 
      Recent evidence suggests that dietary interventions that reduce inflammation, 
      including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), may reduce substance 
      misuse liability. Using the self-directed intake model, we characterize the 
      observed profile of opioid use and demonstrate that an n-3-PUFA-enriched diet 
      ameliorates oxycodone-seeking behaviors in the absence of drug availability and 
      reduces anxiety. Guided by the major role gut microbiota have on brain function, 
      neuropathology, and anxiety, we profile the microbiome composition and the 
      effects of chronic opioid exposure and n-3 PUFA supplementation. We demonstrate 
      that the withdrawal of opioids led to a significant depletion in specific 
      microbiota genera, whereas n-3 PUFA supplementation increased microbial richness, 
      phylogenetic diversity, and evenness. Lastly, we examined the activation state of 
      microglia in the striatum and found that n-3 PUFA supplementation reduced the 
      basal activation state of microglia. These preclinical data suggest that a diet 
      enriched in n-3 PUFAs could be used as a treatment to alleviate anxiety induced 
      opioid-seeking behavior and relapse in human opioid addiction.

AB  - Pharmacological effects of hydroalcoholic extract prepared from Hypericum 
      origanifolium Willd. (Guttiferae) on behavioral parameters and pain perceptions 
      of mice were investigated in this study. Depression, anxiety, spontaneous 
      locomotor activity, and motor coordination parameters of mice were assessed by 
      modified forced swimming, hole board, activity cage, and rota-rod tests, 
      respectively. In addition, antinociceptive effect was evaluated by performing 
      hot-plate, tail-clip, and formalin tests. Reboxetine (20 mg/kg), diazepam (1 
      mg/kg), and morphine (10 mg/kg) were used as reference antidepressant, 
      anxiolytic, and analgesic drugs, respectively. Phytochemical analyses exhibited 
      that chlorogenic acid (2317.12 ppm) and rutin (2108.79 ppm) were the main 
      phenolic compounds in the H. origanifolium extract. The extract (50, 100, and 250 
      mg/kg) induced significant antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antinociceptive 
      activities following the acute administrations. Anxiolytic effect was antagonized 
      by flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) 
      pre-treatment, which indicated the participation of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine 
      receptor complex in the activity. Moreover, centrally and peripherally mediated 
      antinociception reversed by naloxone (a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, 
      5 mg/kg, i.p.) pre-treatment, indicating the involvement of opioid system in the 
      pharmacological action. These findings are the first to indicate the 
      pharmacological effects of the H. origanifolium extract on the emotional state 
      and pain perceptions of mice.

TI  - [Corticotrophin-releasing hormone neurons in the central amygdala mediate 
      morphine withdrawal-induced negative emotions].
PG  - 824-832
AB  - Drugs of abuse leads to adaptive changes in the brain stress system, and produces 
      negative affective states including aversion and anxiety after drug use is 
      terminated. Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is the main transmitter in 
      control of response to stressors and is neuronal enriched in the central amygdala 
      (CeA), a sub-region of the extended amygdala playing an important role in 
      integrating emotional information and modulating stress response. The effect of 
      CRH neurons in CeA on the negative emotions on morphine naïve and withdrawal mice 
      is unclear. Thus, we utilized CRH-Cre transgenic mice injected with AAV-mediated 
      Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated By Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to 
      chemogenetically manipulate CRH neurons in CeA. And methods of behavior analysis, 
      including conditioned place aversion (CPA), elevated plus maze and locomotor 
      activity tests, were used to investigate morphine withdrawal-induced negative 
      emotions in mice. The results showed that, inhibiting CRH neurons of CeA 
      decreased the formation of morphine withdrawal-induced CPA, as well as the 
      anxiety level of CRH-Cre mice. Furthermore, specifically activating CRH neurons 
      in CeA evoked CPA and anxiety of morphine naïve mice. Neither inhibiting nor 
      activating CRH neurons had effects on their locomotor activity. These results 
      suggest that CRH neurons in CeA are involved in the mediation of morphine 
      withdrawal-induced negative emotion in mice, providing a theoretical basis for 
      drug addiction and relapse mechanism.

AB  - Opiate dependence is a major health issue and despite the existence of opioid 
      substitution treatment, relapse frequently occurs. Group III metabotropic 
      glutamate (mGlu) receptors has received much attention as a putative target in 
      ethanol and cocaine addiction, but no data on opiate addiction exist. So we 
      investigated the role of group III mGlu receptors in morphine rewarding effects 
      through the expression and the reinstatement of conditioned place preference 
      (CPP) using a newly synthesized mGlu4/mGlu7 receptor orthosteric agonist, 
      LSP2-9166. We found that LSP2-9166 blocked morphine CPP expression and 
      reinstatement after extinction. Blockade of CPP expression with LSP2-9166 was 
      abolished when using XAP044, a mGlu7 antagonist. We also found that LSP2-9166 at 
      the dose active for blocking morphine reward was devoid of any effect on 
      locomotion, hedonic state, spatial memory, anxiety or depression. Altogether our 
      data demonstrated that group III mGlu receptors, and more specifically mGlu7, 
      might be a valuable target in opiate addiction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eating disorders are lethal and heritable; however, the underlying 
      genetic factors are unknown. Binge eating is a highly heritable trait associated 
      with eating disorders that is comorbid with mood and substance use disorders. 
      Therefore, understanding its genetic basis will inform therapeutic development 
      that could improve several comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions. METHODS: We 
      assessed binge eating in closely related C57BL/6 mouse substrains and in an F(2) 
      cross to identify quantitative trait loci associated with binge eating. We used 
      gene targeting to validate candidate genetic factors. Finally, we used 
      transcriptome analysis of the striatum via messenger RNA sequencing to identify 
      the premorbid transcriptome and the binge-induced transcriptome to inform 
      molecular mechanisms mediating binge eating susceptibility and establishment. 
      RESULTS: C57BL/6NJ but not C57BL/6J mice showed rapid and robust escalation in 
      palatable food consumption. We mapped a single genome-wide significant 
      quantitative trait locus on chromosome 11 (logarithm of the odds = 7.4) to a 
      missense mutation in cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2). We 
      validated Cyfip2 as a major genetic factor underlying binge eating in 
      heterozygous knockout mice on a C57BL/6N background that showed reduced binge 
      eating toward a wild-type C57BL/6J-like level. Transcriptome analysis of 
      premorbid genetic risk identified the enrichment terms morphine addiction and 
      retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, whereas binge eating resulted in the 
      downregulation of a gene set enriched for decreased myelination, oligodendrocyte 
      differentiation, and expression. CONCLUSIONS: We identified Cyfip2 as a major 
      significant genetic factor underlying binge eating and provide a behavioral 
      paradigm for future genome-wide association studies in populations with increased 
      genetic complexity.

TI  - Enkephalin analog, cyclo[N(ε),N(β)-carbonyl-D-Lys(2),Dap(5)] enkephalinamide 
      (cUENK6), inhibits the ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in rats.

AB  - An analog of enkephalin, cyclo[N(ε),N(β)-carbonyl-D-Lys(2),Dap(5)] 
      enkephalinamide (cUENK6), is predominantly a functional agonist of μ-opioid 
      receptors (MOPr) and, to a lesser extent, of δ-opioid receptors (DOPr) in vitro. 
      The aim of the present study was to determine whether cUENK6 could affect ethanol 
      withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test in 
      rats. An anxiety-like effect of withdrawal was predicted to occur in the EPM test 
      24 h after the last ethanol administration (2 g/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]; 15% 
      w/v once daily for 9 days). Ethanol withdrawal decreased the percent of time 
      spent by rats in the open arms and the percent of open-arms entries. cUENK6 (0.25 
      nmol), given by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection, significantly 
      reversed these anxiety-like effects of ethanol withdrawal and elevated the 
      percent of time spent by rats in the open arms and the percent of open-arms 
      entries. These effects of cUENK6 were significantly inhibited by the DOPr 
      antagonist naltrindole (NTI) (5 nmol, i.c.v.), but not by the MOPr antagonist 
      β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA) (5 nmol, i.c.v.). The preferential DOPr agonist 
      [Leu(5)]-enkephalin (LeuEnk) (2.7 and 5.4 nmol, i.c.v.) and the MOPr agonist 
      morphine (6.5 and 13 nmol, i.c.v.) reduced the anxiety-like effects of ethanol 
      withdrawal. cUENK6 at the dose of 0.25 nmol did not disturb locomotor activity in 
      the EPM, in contrast to cUENK6 at the dose of 0.5 nmol, and morphine at 6.5 and 
      13 nmol. However, similarly to LeuEnk, cUENK6 induced the anxiolytic-like effects 
      in naïve rats. Thus, our study suggests that cUENK6 reduced ethanol 
      withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior by activation of δ-opioid receptors 
      rather than μ-opioid receptors.

PG  - 433-4
AB  - The stretched attend posture (SAP) in the mouse is an investigatory forward 
      elongation of the body in a novel environment. In a previous study, the 
      anxiolytics diazepam, clobazam, and phenobarbital reduced SAP, and low doses of 
      the non-anxiolytics imipramine and chlorpromazine were ineffective, results which 
      prompted the investigator to propose the SAP test as a screening method for 
      anxiolytics. However, diazepam and clobazam also increased immobility. In the 
      present study, the anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, and buspirone and 
      behaviorally active doses of the non-anxiolytics chlorpromazine and morphine 
      reduced SAP and tended to increase immobility. We concluded that 
      therapeutic-class specificity has not been demonstrated for the SAP test.

AB  - Rats undergoing both naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous opioid withdrawal 
      exhibit anxiogenic behaviors in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Recently, we 
      observed an unexpected result, namely mice exhibited increased EPM open-arm time 
      during naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. This was surprising since this 
      behavioral outcome is usually associated with an anxiolytic profile. This study 
      demonstrates that mice exhibit an increase in both EPM open-arm time and % 
      open-arm entries also during spontaneous opioid withdrawal.

      involved in regulation of mu opioid receptor [MOR] desensitization and 
      morphine-related behaviors, the potential role of GRK2 in regulation of kappa 
      opioid receptor [KOR] functions in vivo has not been established yet. A couple of 
      recent studies have found that GRK2 activity desensitizes KOR functions via 
      decreasing G protein-coupled signaling with sensitizing arrestin-coupled 
      signaling. Nalfurafine, a G protein-biased KOR full agonist, produces an 
      inhibitory effect on alcohol intake in mice, with fewer side effects (sedation, 
      aversion, or anxiety/depression-like behaviors). Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
      analysis, we first identified that nuclear transcript level of grk2 [adrbk1] (but 
      not other grks) was significantly up-regulated in mouse nucleus accumbens shell 
      (NAcs) after chronic excessive alcohol drinking, suggesting alcohol specifically 
      increased NAcs grk2 expression. We then tested whether selective GRK2/3 inhibitor 
      CMPD101 could alter alcohol intake and found that CMPD101 alone had no effect on 
      alcohol drinking. Therefore, we hypothesized that the grk2 increase in the NAcs 
      could modulate the nalfurafine effect on alcohol intake via interacting with the 
      G protein-mediated KOR signaling. Nalfurafine decreased alcohol drinking in a 
      dose-related manner, and pretreatment with CMPD101 enhanced the reduction in 
      alcohol intake induced by nalfurafine, indicating an involvement of GRK2/3 
      blockade in modulating G protein-biased KOR agonism of nalfurafine. Together, our 
      study provides initial evidence relevant to the transcriptional change of grk2 
      gene in the NAc shell after excessive alcohol drinking. Pharmacological GRK2/3 
      blockade enhanced nalfurafine's efficacy, suggesting a GRK2/3-mediated mechanism, 
      probably through the G protein-mediated KOR signaling.

TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological properties of new GABA uptake inhibitors.
PG  - 817-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: γ-Aminobutanoic acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory 
      neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. The identification and 
      subsequent development of the GABA transport inhibitors which enhance the 
      GABA-ergic transmission has shown the important role that GABA transporters play 
      in the control of numerous functions of the nervous system. Compounds which 
      inhibit GABA uptake are used as antiepileptic drugs (tiagabine - a selective GAT1 
      inhibitor), they are also being investigated for other indications, including 
      treatment of psychosis, general anxiety, sleep disorders, drug addiction or acute 
      and chronic pain. METHODS: In this paper, the synthesis of 
      2-substituted-4-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-ylo)-butanamides and 
      2-substituted-4-aminobutanoic acids derivatives is described. These compounds 
      were tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit GABA uptake. The inhibitory 
      potency towards murine plasma membrane GABA transporters (mGAT1-4) was performed 
      as [(3)H]GABA uptake assay based on stably transfected HEK cells. Compound 18, 
      which demonstrated the highest affinity for mGAT1-4 (pIC(50) ranged from 4.42 for 
      mGAT1 to 5.07 for mGAT3), was additionally investigated in several behavioral 
      tests in mice. RESULTS: Compound 18 increased the locomotor activity (14-38%) and 
      had anxiolytic-like properties in the four-plate test (ED(50) = 9.3 mg/kg). It 
      did not show analgesic activity in acute pain model, namely the hot plate test, 
      however, it was antinociceptive in the acetic acid-induced writhing test (ED(50) 
      = 15.3 mg/kg) and in the formalin model of tonic pain. In the latter assay, it 
      diminished nocifensive behavior in both phases and in the first (neurogenic) 
      phase of this test the obtained ED(50) value (5.3 mg/kg) was similar to morphine 
      (3.0 mg/kg). CONCLUSION: Compound 18 exhibited significant anxiolytic-like 
      properties and was antinociceptive in some models of pain in mice. Moreover, it 
      did not impair animals' motor coordination in the chimney test. Some of the 
      described pharmacological activities of compound 18 can be partly explained based 
      on its affinity for plasma membrane GABA transporters.

TI  - A rapid punishment procedure for detection of anxiolytic compounds in mice.
PG  - 52-7
AB  - RATIONALE: Effects of compounds on punished responding have been predictive of 
      anxiolytic efficacy in humans. The use of mice in these tests has been limited, 
      but the utility of this species in drug discovery and for neurobiological inquiry 
      would benefit from a rapid, reliable method. OBJECTIVES: The present experiments 
      were designed to validate a new procedure in mice. METHODS: Male, NIH Swiss mice 
      were food deprived and placed in an experimental chamber with two nose-poke 
      holes. Every nose poke (FR1) produced a 20 mg food pellet. On the following day, 
      a drug vehicle was administered and the mice were again exposed to the FR1 
      schedule. On day 3, a compound was given and the mice were run under a mixed FR1 
      (food), FR1 (food+shock) schedule in alternating, unsignalled periods of 4 and 10 
      min for three cycles. In the 10-min periods, nose-pokes produced both food plus 
      brief electrification of the grid floor (0.5 mA for 100 ms). Effects of compounds 
      on food intake were also evaluated in separate groups of mice. RESULTS: The 
      introduction of shock substantially decreased responding during the 10-min 
      punishment periods without significantly affecting responding during the 
      non-punishment periods. The clinically effective anxiolytic agents 
      chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, and bretazenil, but not buspirone, produced 
      dose-dependent increases in suppressed responding, whereas d-amphetamine, 
      chlorpromazine, and morphine were not effective. Chlordiazepoxide and bretazenil 
      increased food consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The present method enables rapid and 
      reliable evaluation of potential anxiolytic agents in mice with minimal training. 
      Increases in food intake are not necessary for anxiolytic-like effects under 
      these conditions.

TI  - Effects of hawthorn seed and pulp extracts on the central nervous system.
PG  - 924-31
LID - 10.3109/13880200903305500 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Investigating potential central nervous system (CNS) activities of 
      Crataegus monogyna Jacq. (Rosaceae), hawthorn, fruit extracts. OBJECTIVE: 
      Evaluating CNS effects and analgesic activities of hawthorn fruit extracts based 
      on the traditional uses of the plant for neurosedative and pain killer actions. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of hawthorn pulp (HPE) and seed extracts (HSE) at 
      the dose range of 1-1000 mg/kg were examined on anxiety level, spontaneous 
      locomotor activity, motor coordination, and nociceptive perception of mice. 
      Morphine was used as a reference drug. RESULTS: HPE (100-1000 mg/kg) and HSE 
      (10-1000 mg/kg) significantly decreased not only the exploratory behaviors in 
      hole-board experiments, but also the spontaneous locomotor activities in activity 
      cage tests. The same doses of extracts were found to be ineffective in Rota-Rod 
      tests of mice. In tail-clip, hot-plate, and acetic acid-induced writhing tests, 
      quite potent and dose-dependent analgesic activities were seen at 100-1000 mg/kg 
      doses of HPE and 10-1000 mg/kg doses of HSE. Analgesic effects observed in all 
      analgesia tests were antagonized by naloxone. DISCUSSION: Significant and 
      dose-dependent decreases in spontaneous locomotor activities and exploratory 
      behaviors of animals suggested CNS depressant activities of both extracts. 
      Complete naloxone antagonism in all applied analgesia tests indicated 
      opioid-related analgesic activities of both extracts. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      seem to support the traditional use of this plant to treat stress, nervousness, 
      sleep disorders, and pain control.

TI  - Effects of morphine on the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task: role of 
      state-dependent learning.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - RATIONALE: The amnesic effects of morphine may be related to its action on 
      nociception, anxiety, or locomotion. This effect is also suggested to be related 
      to state dependency. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to verify the 
      effects of morphine on mice tested in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task 
      (DAT) that uses light and noise as aversive stimuli and allows the concomitant 
      evaluation of learning, memory, anxiety, and locomotion and also to verify the 
      possible role of state-dependent learning in the effects of morphine. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: The DAT was conducted in a modified elevated plus-maze. In the training, 
      the aversive stimuli were applied when mice entered in one of the enclosed arms, 
      whereas in the test, no stimuli were applied. The main results showed that (1) 
      pretraining morphine (5-20 mg/kg i.p.) induced retrieval deficits (evaluated by 
      the time spent in the aversive arm in the test) but not acquisition deficits 
      (evaluated by the decrease in aversive arm exploration along the training); (2) 
      pretest morphine (5-10 but not 20 mg/kg) counteracted this deficit; (3) morphine 
      induced hypolocomotion (decreased number of entries in the arms), irrespective of 
      memory alterations; and (4) morphine did not alter anxiety-like behavior 
      (evaluated by the time spent in the open arms) during the training. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Morphine given before training induces retrieval deficits in mice tested in the 
      DAT, and these deficits could be related to morphine-induced state-dependent 
      learning. Neither the memory deficit induced by pretraining morphine nor the 
      reversal of this deficit by pretest morphine seems to be related to anxiety 
      levels or locomotor alterations.

TI  - Preventive putative effect of agmatine on cognitive and molecular outcomes in 
      ventral tegmental area of male offspring following physical and psychological 
      prenatal stress.
PG  - e22410
LID - 10.1002/dev.22410 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal stress (PS) results from a maternal experience of stressful events 
      during pregnancy, which has been associated with an increased risk of behavioral 
      disorders including substance abuse and anxiety in the offspring. PS is known to 
      result in heightened dopamine release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), in 
      part through the effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone, which directly 
      excites dopaminergic cells. It has recently been suggested that agmatine plays a 
      role in modulating anxiety-like behaviors. In this study, we investigated whether 
      agmatine could reduce negative cognitive outcomes in male mice prenatally exposed 
      to psychological/physical stress, and whether this could be associated with 
      molecular changes in VTA. Agmatine (37.5 mg/kg) was administrated 30 min prior to 
      PS induction in pregnant Swiss mice. Male offspring were evaluated in a series of 
      behavioral and molecular assays. Findings demonstrated that agmatine reduced the 
      impairment in locomotor activity induced by both psychological and physical PS. 
      Agmatine also decreased heightened conditioned place preference to morphine seen 
      in PS offspring. Moreover, agmatine ameliorated the anxiety-like behavior and 
      drug-seeking behavior induced by PS in the male offspring. Molecular effects were 
      seen in VTA as the enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced by 
      PS in the VTA was reduced by agmatine. Behavioral tests indicate that agmatine 
      exerts a protective effect on PS-induced impairments in male offspring, which 
      could be due in part to agmatine-associated molecular alterations in the VTA. 
      Taken together, our data suggest that prenatal treatment with agmatine exerts 
      protective effect against negative consequences of PS on the development of 
      affective circuits in the offspring.

AB  - The influence of citalopram (20 mg/kg i.p.) and buspirone (3 mg/kg i.p.) on 
      analgesic effects of morphine (10 mg/kg i.p.), metamizole (500 mg/kg i.p.) and

      The research studies were further conducted with multiple (14 days) drug dosage. 
      The results indicate that citalopram and buspirone decrease analgesic effects of 
      morphine, metamizole and indomethacin. This mode of action is more pronounced in 
      case of a single dose than after multiple doses.

TI  - Role of ventral hippocampal NMDA receptors in anxiolytic-like effect of morphine.
PG  - 608-13
LID - 10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.09.013 [doi]
AB  - The possible role of ventral hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on 
      morphine-induced anxiolytic-like behavior in an elevated plus maze (EPM) task was 
      investigated in the present study. Adult male mice (7 per group) with cannulas 
      aimed at the ventral hippocampus (VH) received NMDA or a competitive NMDA 
      receptor antagonist D-AP5 with or without morphine and 30min later were subjected 
      to an EPM task. Intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of morphine (3-9mg/kg) increased 
      the percentage of open arm time (%OAT) and open arm entries (%OAE), which 
      suggested an anxiolytic-like effect. Intra-VH microinjection of NMDA 
      (0.5-1μg/mouse) with an ineffective dose of morphine (3mg/kg, i.p.) significantly 
      increased %OAT and %OAE. However, microinjections of the same doses of NMDA into 
      the VH in the absence of morphine had no effect on %OAT and %OAE. Intra-VH 
      microinjection of D-AP5 (0.5-2μg/mouse) decreased the anxiolytic-like effect of 
      morphine, while intra-VH microinjection of the same doses of D-AP5 alone 
      increased %OAT and %OAE, which indicated an anxiolytic response. Furthermore, 
      intra-VH microinjection of D-AP5 reversed the effect of NMDA response to the 
      administration of a lower morphine dose as seen in the EPM task. It should be 
      noted that intra-VH microinjection of D-AP5 plus NMDA, 5min before morphine 
      increased locomotor activity, while other treatments had no effect on this 
      parameter. The results suggest that VH-NMDA receptors participate in the 
      mediation of morphine-induced anxiolytic-like behavior.

TI  - Regulator of G-Protein Signaling 4 (RGS4) Controls Morphine Reward by Glutamate 
      Receptor Activation in the Nucleus Accumbens of Mouse Brain.
PG  - 454-464
LID - 10.14348/molcells.2018.0023 [doi]
AB  - Crosstalk between G-protein signaling and glutamatergic transmission within the 
      brain reward circuits is critical for long-term emotional effects (depression and 
      anxiety), cravings, and negative withdrawal symptoms associated with opioid 
      addiction. A previous study showed that Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) 
      may be implicated in opiate action in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the 
      mechanism of the NAc-specific RGS4 actions that induce the behavioral responses 
      to opiates remains largely unknown. The present study used a short hairpin RNA 
      (shRNA)-mediated knock-down of RGS4 in the NAc of the mouse brain to investigate 
      the relationship between the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and 
      RGS4 in the NAc during morphine reward. Additionally, the shRNA-mediated RGS4 
      knock-down was implemented in NAc/striatal primary-cultured neurons to 
      investigate the role that striatal neurons have in the morphine-induced 
      activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The results of this study show that 
      the NAc-specific knockdown of RGS4 significantly increased the behaviors 
      associated with morphine and did so by phosphorylation of the GluR1 (Ser831) and 
      NR2A (Tyr1325) glutamate receptors in the NAc. Furthermore, the knock-down of 
      RGS4 enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluR1 and NR2A glutamate receptors in 
      the primary NAc/striatal neurons during spontaneous morphine withdrawal. These 
      findings show a novel molecular mechanism of RGS4 in glutamatergic transmission 
      that underlies the negative symptoms associated with morphine administration.

TI  - Avoidance enhancement and discriminative response control by anxiolytics with 
      drugs acting on the GABA system.
PG  - 325-36
AB  - Two types of conditioned behaviors were investigated for the purpose of 
      evaluating anxiolytic drugs. A conditioning procedure used was an active 
      avoidance in poorly-performing mice. Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, chlorazepate and 
      meprobamate increased the avoidance rate, while chlorpromazine, haloperidol and 
      nortriptyline did not produce such an effect. The effect of diazepam was 
      potentiated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and aminoxyacetic acid (AOAA) and 
      antagonized by picrotoxin and thiosemicarbazide, but was influenced little by 
      spiroperidol, alpha-methyltyrosine, phenoxybenzamine and levallorphan. In 
      addition, the effect of other anxiolytics was potentiated by AOAA and antagonized 
      by picrotoxin. Biperiden, methamphetamine, caffeine and morphine also induced an 
      avoidance enhancement, which was not influenced by AOAA. A drug discrimination 
      experiment was also performed using a milk-reinforced two-lever operant method. 
      In the rats trained to discriminate phenobarbital from saline, diazepam produced 
      a dose-related phenobarbital-lever selection, which was potentiated by AOAA and 
      antagonized by picrotoxin. Chlordiazepoxide, chlorazepate and meprobamate also 
      elicited responses on the phenobarbital-lever. On the other hand, haloperidol, 
      nortriptyline, biperiden, methamphetamine, caffeine and morphine produced a 
      saline-lever selection, at the doses tested. These results suggest that, among 
      several drugs tested, the avoidance enhancement and discriminative response 
      control by anxiolytics may be closely linked with the GABA system.

TI  - Pharmacological mechanism in slip-down behavior of mice.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - Slip-down from a raised platform was previously found in mice treated with 
      morphine, and this behavior was also recognized in mice treated with a monoamine 
      releaser methamphetamine. Pharmacological examination on the slip-down indicated 
      that the behavior was induced by receptor stimulations by D2 agonist PPHT and 
      5HT-2 agonist DOI. In mice treated with PPHT, antagonists of D1, alpha2, 5HT-2 
      and opioid mu and kappa suppressed the behavior. In mice treated with DOI, 
      antagonists of D1, alpha2, 5HT-1A, 5HT-3 and opioid mu and delta suppressed the 
      behavior. These present findings suggest that the slip-down was mainly induced by 
      opioid mu receptor activity regulated with monoamine activities. When the 
      slip-down is considered as an anxious behavior, it may be also suggested that the 
      anxiety induced by 5-HT activities furthermore stimulated the behavior via the 
      other opioid receptor activities.

TI  - Reduction of predator odor-induced anxiety in mice by the neurosteroid 3 
      alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3 alpha HP).
PG  - 325-9
AB  - The effects of the centrally produced allylic neurosteroid, 3 
      alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3 alpha HP), on the responses of male mice to an 
      aversive, anxiety-inducing, predator (cat) odor were examined in an odor 
      preference test. Control untreated mice displayed an anxiogenic response to the 
      cat odor, spending a minimal amount of time in a Y-maze in the vicinity of the 
      cat odor. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administrations of 3 alpha HP had an 
      anxiolytic action, resulting in significant dose-related (0.01-1.0 micrograms) 
      increases in the amount of time spent in the proximity of the cat odor. These 
      anxiolytic effects of 3 alpha HP were stereospecific, with the stereoisomer, 3 
      beta-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3 beta HP) having no significant effects on odor 
      preferences. The analgesic, morphine, also had no significant effects on the 
      response to cat odor indicating that the anxiolytic actions of 3 alpha HP were 
      unlikely to be related to any analgesic effects. The effects of 3 alpha HP were 
      significantly reduced by peripheral administrations of the GABAA antagonists, 
      bicuculline and picrotoxin, but were unaffected by either the benzodiazepine 
      antagonist, Ro 15-1788, or the opiate antagonist, naloxone. These results 
      indicate that the allylic neurosteroid 3 alpha HP has anxiolytic actions 
      involving interactions with the GABAA receptor.

TI  - Behavioral and pharmacological studies on gluten exorphin A5, a newly isolated 
      bioactive food protein fragment, in mice.
PG  - 259-65
AB  - Central effects of gluten exorphin A5 (Gly-Tyr-Tyr-Pro-Thr), a fragment from 
      wheat gluten, were studied on the pain-inhibitory system, emotionality and 
      learning/memory processes in mice. Orally administered gluten exorphin A5 
      produced neither an antinociceptive effect nor an effect on morphine analgesia. 
      Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered gluten exorphin A5 produced mild 
      but significant antinociception in a dose-depepndent manner, while not affecting 
      the morphine analgesia. On the other hand, oral gluten exorphin A5 suppressed the 
      endogenous pain-inhibitory system, i.e., antinociception induced by 
      socio-psychological- (PSY-) stress (SIA) using a communication box; 
      intraperitoneal gluten exorphin A5 abolished both footshock- (FS-) stress-induced 
      antinociception (SIA) and PSY-SIA; and i.c.v. gluten exorphin A5 suppressed 
      FS-SIA, but rather potentiated PSY-SIA. This peptide given by these routes was 
      without effect on forced swim-SIA. In addition, oral gluten exorphin A5 tended to 
      prolong the retention time on open arms in the elevated plus-maze test. Finally, 
      oral gluten exorphin A5 when given during the post-training period of 
      learning/memory processes significantly increased the latency into the dark 
      compartment in the one-trail step-though type passive avoidance test, indicating 
      that the peptide also facilitates the acquire/consolidation process of 
      learning/memory. Thus, gluten exorphin A5 has been found to produce various 
      effects not only in the peripheral nervous systems but also in the central 
      nervous system.

AB  - Presynaptic Ca(V)2.2 channels control calcium entry that triggers 
      neurotransmitter release at both central and peripheral synapses. The Cacna1b 
      gene encodes the α1-pore forming subunit of Ca(V)2.2 channels. Distinct subsets 
      of splice variants of Ca(V)2.2 derived from cell-specific alternative splicing of 
      the Cacna1b pre-mRNA are expressed in specific subpopulations of neurons. Four 
      cell-specific sites of alternative splicing in Cacna1b that alter Ca(V)2.2 
      channel function have been described in detail: three cassette exons (e18a, e24a, 
      and e31a) and a pair of mutually exclusive exons (e37a/e37b). Cacna1b mRNAs 
      containing e37a are highly enriched in a subpopulation of nociceptors where they 
      influence nociception and morphine analgesia. E37a-Cacna1b mRNAs are also 
      expressed in brain, but their cell-specific expression in this part of the 
      nervous system, their functional consequences in central synapses and their role 
      on complex behavior have not been studied. In this report, we show that 
      e37a-Cacna1b mRNAs are expressed in excitatory projection neurons where Ca(V)2.2 
      channels are known to influence transmitter release at excitatory inputs from 
      entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate gyrus (DG). By comparing behaviors of WT mice 
      to those that only express e37b-Ca(V)2.2 channels, we found evidence that 
      e37a-Ca(V)2.2 enhances behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. Our results 
      suggest that alternative splicing of Cacna1b e37a influences excitatory 
      transmitter release and couples to complex behaviors.

TI  - Sciatic nerve cuffing in mice: a model of sustained neuropathic pain.
PG  - 591-9
AB  - Because of its severity, chronicity, resistance to usual therapy and its 
      consequences on quality of life, neuropathic pain represents a real clinical 
      challenge. Fundamental research on this pathology uses metabolic, pharmacological 
      or traumatic models in rodents that reproduce the characteristic human pain 
      symptoms. In 1996, Mosconi and Kruger morphologically described a model of 
      peripheral neuropathy in which a cuff of polyethylene tubing was placed around 
      the sciatic nerve in rats. In the present study, we evaluated the behavioral 
      consequences of this neuropathic pain model in C57Bl/6J mice which is the main 
      genetic background used for studies in transgenic mice. A short cuff of 
      polyethylene tubing was unilaterally placed around the main branch of the sciatic 
      nerve. It induced an ipsilateral heat thermal hyperalgesia lasting around 3 
      weeks, and a sustained ipsilateral mechanical allodynia lasting at least 2 
      months. We showed that this neuropathic pain model is insensitive to ketoprofen, 
      a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Morphine treatment acutely suppressed the 
      mechanical allodynia, but tolerance to this effect rapidly developed. The 
      analysis of video recordings revealed that most aspects of spontaneous behavior 
      remained unaffected on the long term, excepted for a decrease in the time spent 
      at social interaction for the neuropathic mice. Using the elevated plus-maze and 
      the marble-burying test, we also showed that neuropathic mice develop an anxiety 
      phenotype. Our data indicate that sciatic nerve cuffing in mice is a pertinent 
      model for the study of nociceptive and emotional consequences of sustained 
      neuropathic pain.

TI  - Dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors mediate neuropeptide S-induced antinociception 
      in the mouse formalin test.

AB  - Neuropeptide S (NPS) is the endogenous ligand of a G-protein coupled receptor 
      named NPS receptor. The NPS system controls several biological functions, 
      including anxiety, wakefulness, locomotor activity, food intake, and pain 
      transmission. A growing body of evidence supports facilitatory effects for NPS 
      over dopaminergic neurotransmission. The present study was aimed to investigate 
      the role of dopamine receptors signaling in the antinociceptive effects of NPS in 
      the mouse formalin test. The following dopamine receptor antagonists were 
      employed: SCH 23390 (selective dopamine D(1) antagonist, 0.05 mg/kg, ip), 
      haloperidol (non-selective dopamine D(2)-like receptor antagonist; 0.03 mg/kg, 
      ip), and sulpiride (selective dopamine D(2)-like receptor antagonist; 25 mg/kg, 
      ip). Mice were pretreated with dopamine antagonists before the supraspinal 
      administration of NPS (0.1 nmol, icv). Morphine (5 mg/kg, sc) and indomethacin 
      (10 mg/kg, ip) were used as positive controls to set up the experimental 
      conditions. Morphine-induced antinociceptive effects were observed during phases 
      1 and 2 of the test, while indomethacin was only active at phase 2. Central NPS 
      significantly reduced formalin-induced nociception during both phases. The 
      systemic administration of SCH 23390 slightly blocked the effects of NPS only 
      during phase 2. Haloperidol prevented NPS-induced antinociceptive effects. 
      Similar to haloperidol, sulpiride also counteracted the antinociceptive effects 
      of NPS in both phases of the formalin test. In conclusion, the present findings 
      suggest that the analgesic effects of NPS are linked with dopaminergic 
      neurotransmission mainly through dopamine D(2)-like receptor signaling.

TI  - Age-related changes of anandamide metabolism in CB1 cannabinoid receptor knockout 
      mice: correlation with behaviour.
PG  - 1178-86
AB  - Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) 
      are the most active endocannabinoids at brain (CB1) cannabinoid receptors. CD1 
      mice lacking the CB1 receptors ("knockout" [KO] mutants) were compared with 
      wildtype (WT) littermates for their ability to degrade AEA through an AEA 
      membrane transporter (AMT) and an AEA hydrolase (fatty acid amide hydrolase, 
      FAAH). The age dependence of AMT and FAAH activity were investigated in 1- or 
      4-month-old WT and KO animals, and found to increase with age in KO, but not WT, 
      mice and to be higher in the hippocampus than in the cortex of all animals. AEA 
      and 2-AG were detected in nmol/mg protein (microm) concentrations in both 
      regions, though the hippocampus showed approximately twice the amount found in 
      the cortex. In the same regions, 2-AG failed to change across groups, while AEA 
      was significantly decreased (approximately 30%) in hippocampus, but not in 
      cortex, of old KO mice, when compared with young KO or age-matched WT animals. In 
      the open-field test under bright light and in the lit-dark exploration model of 
      anxiety, young KO mice, compared with old KO, exhibited a mild anxiety-related 
      behaviour. In contrast, neither the increase in memory performance assessed by 
      the object recognition test, nor the reduction of morphine withdrawal symptoms, 
      showed age dependence in CB1 KO mice. These results suggest that invalidation of 
      the CB1 receptor gene is associated with age-dependent adaptive changes of 
      endocannabinoid metabolism which appear to correlate with the waning of the 
      anxiety-like behaviour exhibited by young CB1 KO mice.

TI  - CB1 receptor knockout mice show similar behavioral modifications to wild-type 
      mice when enkephalin catabolism is inhibited.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - Behavioral and biochemical studies have suggested a functional link between the 
      endogenous cannabinoid and opioid systems. Different hypotheses have been 
      proposed to explain the interactions between opioid and cannabinoid systems such 
      as a common pathway stimulating the dopaminergic system, a facilitation of 
      signal-transduction- and/or a cannabinoid-induced enhancement of opioid peptide 
      release. However, at this time, all the studies have been performed with 
      exogenous agonists (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or morphine), leading to a 
      generally excessive stimulation of receptors normally stimulated by endogenous 
      effectors (anandamide or opioid peptides) in various brain structures. To 
      overcome this problem, we have measured various behavioral responses induced by 
      the stimulation of the endogenous opioid system using the dual inhibitor of 
      enkephalin-degrading enzymes, RB101, in CB1 receptor knockout mice. Thus, 
      analgesia, locomotor activity, anxiety and antidepressant-like effects were 
      measured after RB101 administration (80 and 120 mg/kg i.p. or 10 mg/kg, i.v.) in 
      CB1 receptor knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. In all the 
      experiments, inhibition of enkephalin catabolism produced similar modifications 
      in behavior observed in CB1 knockout and wild-type mice. These results suggest 
      limited physiological interaction between cannabinoid and opioid systems.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of swimming 
      exercise on elevated plus-maze (EPM)-associated memory deficit induced by 
      intra-CA1 injection of scopolamine (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 
      antagonist used to model Alzheimer's disease in rodents) in male mice. In 
      addition, involvement of the mu opioid receptors in this phenomenon was 
      investigated. MAIN METHODS: Bilateral guide cannulae were implanted to allow 
      intra-CA1 microinjections. KEY FINDINGS: Data showed that mice with 10 and 20 
      days of swimming, only acquired the emotional memory, while 30 days of swimming 
      exercise improved it. On the other hand, pretest intra-CA1 injection of 
      scopolamine at the doses of 2 and 3 but not 1 μg/mouse reduced the emotional 
      memory. Our results demonstrated that 20 days of swimming by itself and without 
      any drug injection restored the emotional memory deficit induced by intra-CA1 
      injection of scopolamine, only at the dose of 2 but not 3 μg/mouse. Moreover, 
      once daily injection of the subthreshold doses of morphine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, 
      i.p.) during the last 7 days of the 20 day-swimming intervention, improved the 
      emotional memory deficit induced by scopolamine (3 μg/mouse) and this effect 
      could be blocked by the subthreshold doses of naloxone (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg). It 
      was noted that all previous interventions did not alter the anxiety-like 
      behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE: Swimming improved the emotional memory by itself and 
      restored the emotional memory deficit induced by the intra-CA1 injection of 
      scopolamine. Mu opioid receptor-dependent mechanism(s) is(are) suggested to play 
      a role in this phenomenon.

TI  - Preclinical Testing of Nalfurafine as an Opioid-sparing Adjuvant that Potentiates 
      Analgesia by the Mu Opioid Receptor-targeting Agonist Morphine.
PG  - 487-499
LID - 10.1124/jpet.118.255661 [doi]
AB  - Mu opioid receptor (MOR)-targeting analgesics are efficacious pain treatments, 
      but notorious for their abuse potential. In preclinical animal models, 
      coadministration of traditional kappa opioid receptor (KOR)-targeting agonists 
      with MOR-targeting analgesics can decrease reward and potentiate analgesia. 
      However, traditional KOR-targeting agonists are well known for inducing 
      antitherapeutic side effects (psychotomimesis, depression, anxiety, dysphoria). 
      Recent data suggest that some functionally selective, or biased, KOR-targeting 
      agonists might retain the therapeutic effects of KOR activation without inducing 
      undesirable side effects. Nalfurafine, used safely in Japan since 2009 for uremic 
      pruritus, is one such functionally selective KOR-targeting agonist. Here, we 
      quantify the bias of nalfurafine and several other KOR agonists relative to an 
      unbiased reference standard (U50,488) and show that nalfurafine and 
      EOM-salvinorin-B demonstrate marked G protein-signaling bias. While nalfurafine 
      (0.015 mg/kg) and EOM-salvinorin-B (1 mg/kg) produced spinal antinociception 
      equivalent to 5 mg/kg U50,488, only nalfurafine significantly enhanced the 
      supraspinal analgesic effect of 5 mg/kg morphine. In addition, 0.015 mg/kg 
      nalfurafine did not produce significant conditioned place aversion, yet retained 
      the ability to reduce morphine-induced conditioned place preference in C57BL/6J 
      mice. Nalfurafine and EOM-salvinorin-B each produced robust inhibition of both 
      spontaneous and morphine-stimulated locomotor behavior, suggesting a persistence 
      of sedative effects when coadministered with morphine. Taken together, these 
      findings suggest that nalfurafine produces analgesic augmentation, while also 
      reducing opioid-induced reward with less risk of dysphoria. Thus, adjuvant 
      administration of G protein-biased KOR agonists like nalfurafine may be 
      beneficial in enhancing the therapeutic potential of MOR-targeting analgesics, 
      such as morphine.

AB  - The anticonvulsant effects of 
      2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX), phencyclidine (PCP) 
      and diazepam against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice and against seizures 
      induced by methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) in 
      NMRI mice were compared. Motor impairment was assessed in a rotarod apparatus in 
      DBA/2 as well as NMRI mice. At 30 min after i.p. administration, NBQX was as 
      effective as PCP and diazepam in protecting against audiogenic seizures and had a 
      therapeutic ratio slightly higher than diazepam's and 7-fold higher than PCP's. 
      Whereas diazepam was fully effective, NBQX and PCP were both ineffective against 
      seizures induced by DMCM 30 min after i.p. administration. The anticonvulsant 
      potential and motor-impairing effects of NBQX were evaluated further by the i.p. 
      and the i.v. routes at different time points after administration. At all 
      pretreatment intervals, NBQX protected against audiogenic seizures more potently 
      than it produced motor impairment. NBQX administered i.p. protected against 
      DMCM-induced seizures when given 15 min but not 5 min before testing, whereas 
      after i.v. administration NBQX produced anticonvulsant and motor-impairing 
      effects in the same dose range. NBQX only slightly and non-dose-dependently 
      attenuated the discriminative effects of pentylenetetrazole in rats, showing a 
      limited anxiolytic potential. NBQX produced no PCP-like or morphine-like 
      discriminative effects in rats, suggesting lack of PCP or opiate-like subjective 
      effects. These data demonstrate that NBQX has anticonvulsant effects, has limited 
      anxiolytic effects, and does not produce subjective effects of PCP or opiate 
      type.

TI  - A combined marble burying-locomotor activity test in mice: a practical screening 
      test with sensitivity to different classes of anxiolytics and antidepressants.
PG  - 106-15
AB  - Over the last decades, the inhibition of spontaneous burying of glass marbles by 
      mice has been used as an index of anxiolytic drug action in the so-called marble 
      burying test. Indeed, acute administration of rapid-onset (e.g. diazepam) and 
      slow-onset (e.g. fluoxetine) anxiolytics inhibit marble burying. However, 
      non-anxiolytic compounds such as classical antipsychotics also reduce marble 
      burying thus suggesting that the predictive validity of this procedure for 
      anxiety may be limited. In the present study, after having selected a strain of 
      mice (C57BL/6J) that showed spontaneous avoidance of glass marbles, we tried to 
      improve the predictive validity of the marble burying test for anxiety by 
      measuring locomotor activity during the marble burying test and--if needed--in 
      control experiments by using a videotracking system. Twenty-four reference 
      compounds were tested including anxiolytics, anxiogenics, antidepressants, 
      antipsychotics and other classes. By comparing marble burying scores with 
      locomotor measures, we found that, based on our criteria, most of the anxiolytics 
      and antidepressants selectively inhibited marble burying in contrast to most of 
      the other compounds (e.g. haloperidol, morphine). Two putative anxiolytics, i.e. 
      the nociceptin orphanin FQ peptide receptor agonist Ro 64-6198 and the 
      metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine, 
      also showed a selective profile. We propose this modified procedure, requiring 
      only a limited number of animals, as a valuable screening test for the detection 
      of compounds having anxiolytic effects.

      sleep-inducer (III). Behavioral study on interactions of 450191-S and other drugs 
      in mice].
PG  - 155-73
AB  - Interactions between 450191-S and other representative drugs which might be 
      clinically used with 450191-S were behaviorally investigated in mice, and 
      compared with the cases of nitrazepam, estazolam and triazolam. The potencies of 
      450191-S and nitrazepam in preventing pentetrazol convulsions were markedly 
      decreased by aminopyrine, whereas that of estazolam was remarkably increased by 
      phenytoin. Administration of nitrazepam with other drugs, except aminopyrine, or 
      of estazolam together with haloperidol exhibited an anticonvulsive pattern 
      different from the case of dosing with either drug alone. Only the effect of 
      triazolam was not influenced by any drugs used. The potency of haloperidol 
      against apomorphine-induced climbing behavior was significantly reduced by 
      nitrazepam, and the pattern of the haloperidol effect was changed by treatment 
      together with 450191-S or estazolam. However, triazolam had no influence on the 
      effect of haloperidol. The antagonistic activity of imipramine to 
      reserpine-induced hypothermia was slightly decreased by 450191-S, estazolam and 
      triazolam, but little affected by nitrazepam. In the protection from maximal 
      electroshock convulsions (MEC), the potency of phenytoin was significantly 
      decreased by 450191-S and triazolam. Moreover, the anti-MES pattern of phenytoin 
      was altered by nitrazepam. Estazolam exerted no significant influence on the 
      effect of phenytoin. Analgesic activities of morphine and/or aminopyrine were 
      potentiated by pretreatment with sleep-inducers, but not 450191-S. Thus, judging 
      from the potency and stability of the anti-pentetrazol effect, 450191-S seems to 
      be inferior to triazolam, but superior to nitrazepam and estazolam. Also, 
      450191-S may be differentiated from other sleep-inducers by the fact that only 
      450191-S did not potentiate the analgesic activities of morphine and aminopyrine.

TI  - Decreased predator avoidance in parasitized mice: neuromodulatory correlates.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - Although parasites are reported to alter host responses to predators, little is 
      known about the neurochemical mechanisms involved. Using an odour preference 
      test, we examined the effects of an acute, subclinical infection with the 
      naturally occurring, single host, enteric protozoan parasite, Eimeria 
      vermiformis, on the responses of male laboratory mice, Mus musculus, to a 
      predator. Uninfected mice avoided the odour of a predatory cat, spending a 
      minimal amount of time in a Y-maze in the vicinity of the cat odour. In contrast, 
      mice infected with E. vermiformis, spent a significantly greater amount of time 
      in the proximity of the cat odour, showing a reduced avoidance of the cat odour 
      and a reduction in predator-induced fear or anxiety. This was not related to 
      augmented opioid activity and decreased pain sensitivity in the infected mice, as 
      neither treatment with the exogenous opiate, morphine, nor restraint 
      stress-induced augmentation of endogenous opioid activity, had any significant 
      effects on the responses of uninfected mice to cat odour. The altered responses 
      of the infected mice to the cat odour were reduced by peripheral administration 
      of the gamma-aminobutyric A (GABAA) antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, but 
      were not significantly affected by either the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 
      15-1788, the opiate antagonist, naloxone, or the excitatory amino acid, 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, MK-801. These results indicate that 
      infection with E. vermiformis in mice reduces the avoidance of predator odour 
      through neurochemical systems associated with anxiety involving, at least in 
      part, GABAA receptor mechanisms.

TI  - CRF2 Receptor Deficiency Eliminates the Long-Lasting Vulnerability of 
      Motivational States Induced by Opiate Withdrawal.
PG  - 1990-2000
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.49 [doi]
AB  - Vulnerability to stressful life events is a hallmark of drug dependence that may 
      persist long after cessation of drug intake and dramatically fuel key clinical 
      features, such as deregulated up-shifted motivational states and craving. 
      However, to date, no effective therapy is available for reducing vulnerability to 
      stressful events in former drug users and drug-dependent patients, mostly because 
      of poor knowledge of the mechanisms underlying it. In this study, we report that 
      genetic inactivation of the stress-responsive corticotropin-releasing factor 
      receptor-2 (CRF2-/-) completely eliminates the reemergence of increased 
      nonrewarded nose-pokes, reflecting up-shifted motivational states, triggered by 
      ethological environmental stressors long after cessation of morphine 
      administration in mice. Accordingly, CRF2 receptor deficiency completely 
      abolishes the increase in biomarkers of synthesis of major brain motivational 
      substrates, such as ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) and amygdala 
      γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems, associated with the stress-induced 
      reemergence of up-shifted motivational states long after opiate withdrawal. 
      Nevertheless, neither CRF2 receptor deficiency nor long-term opiate withdrawal 
      affects amygdala CRF or hypothalamus CRF expression, indicating preserved brain 
      stress-coping systems. Moreover, CRF2 receptor deficiency does not influence the 
      locomotor or the anxiety-like effect of long-term opiate withdrawal. Thus, the 
      present results reveal an essential and specific role for the CRF2 receptor in 
      the stress-induced reemergence of up-shifted motivational states and related 
      alterations in brain motivational systems long after opiate withdrawal. These 
      findings suggest new strategies for the treatment of the severe and long-lasting 
      vulnerability that inexorably follows drug withdrawal and hinder drug abstinence.

TI  - BU08073 a buprenorphine analogue with partial agonist activity at μ-receptors in 
      vitro but long-lasting opioid antagonist activity in vivo in mice.
PG  - 668-80
LID - 10.1111/bph.12796 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Buprenorphine is a potent analgesic with high affinity at 
      μ, δ and κ and moderate affinity at nociceptin opioid (NOP) receptors. 
      Nevertheless, NOP receptor activation modulates the in vivo activity of 
      buprenorphine. Structure activity studies were conducted to design buprenorphine 
      analogues with high affinity at each of these receptors and to characterize them 
      in in vitro and in vivo assays. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Compounds were tested for 
      binding affinity and functional activity using [(35) S]GTPγS binding at each 
      receptor and a whole-cell fluorescent assay at μ receptors. BU08073 was evaluated 
      for antinociceptive agonist and antagonist activity and for its effects on 
      anxiety in mice. KEY RESULTS: BU08073 bound with high affinity to all opioid 
      receptors. It had virtually no efficacy at δ, κ and NOP receptors, whereas at μ 
      receptors, BU08073 has similar efficacy as buprenorphine in both functional 
      assays. Alone, BU08073 has anxiogenic activity and produces very little 
      antinociception. However, BU08073 blocks morphine and U50,488-mediated 
      antinociception. This blockade was not evident at 1 h post-treatment, but is 
      present at 6 h and remains for up to 3-6 days. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: 
      These studies provide structural requirements for synthesis of 'universal' opioid 
      ligands. BU08073 had high affinity for all the opioid receptors, with moderate 
      efficacy at μ receptors and reduced efficacy at NOP receptors, a profile 
      suggesting potential analgesic activity. However, in vivo, BU08073 had 
      long-lasting antagonist activity, indicating that its pharmacokinetics determined 
      both the time course of its effects and what receptor-mediated effects were 
      observed. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Opioids:

TI  - Rewarding effects of opiates are absent in mice lacking the receptor for 
      substance P.
PG  - 180-3
AB  - Modulation of substance P activity offers a radical new approach to the 
      management of depression, anxiety and stress. The substance P receptor is highly 
      expressed in areas of the brain that are implicated in these behaviours, but also 
      in other areas such as the nucleus accumbens which mediate the motivational 
      properties of both natural rewards such as food and of drugs of abuse such as 
      opiates. Here we show a loss of the rewarding properties of morphine in mice with 
      a genetic disruption of the substance P receptor. The loss was specific to 
      morphine, as both groups of mice responded when cocaine or food were used as 
      rewards. The physical response to opiate withdrawal was also reduced in substance 
      P receptor knockout mice. We conclude that substance P has an important and 
      specific role in mediating the motivational aspects of opiates and may represent 
      a new pharmacological route for the control of drug abuse.

TI  - Diazepam pretreatment suppresses morphine withdrawal signs in the mouse.
PG  - 349-57
AB  - The effect of diazepam on the development of physical dependence on morphine and 
      on the naloxone-precipitated increase in cortical NA turnover were investigated 
      in mice. Co-administration of diazepam (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.) during chronic morphine 
      treatment suppressed the expression of naloxone (3 mg/kg, s.c.)-precipitated 
      withdrawal signs (jumping, exploratory rearing and weight loss). However, a 
      single injection of diazepam (4 mg/kg, i.p.) in morphine-dependent mice did not 
      affect the expression of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs. The 
      3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) level and noradrenaline (NA) 
      turnover (MHPG/NA) in the cerebral cortex were increased by naloxone (3 mg/kg) 
      challenge. These increases in the cortical MHPG level and NA turnover were 
      significantly prevented by co-administration of diazepam (4 mg/kg, i.p.) during 
      chronic morphine treatment. These findings suggest that the co-administration of 
      diazepam during chronic morphine treatment may prevent some neurochemical changes 
      in the central noradrenergic system during chronic morphine treatment, and may 
      suppress the development of physical dependence on morphine. Therefore, the 
      inhibitory action of GABA via benzodiazepine binding sites may play an important 
      role in the development of physical dependence on morphine.

TI  - Antidepressant-like effects of BU10119, a novel buprenorphine analogue with mixed 
      κ/μ receptor antagonist properties, in mice.
PG  - 2869-2880
LID - 10.1111/bph.14060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The κ receptor antagonists have potential for treating 
      neuropsychiatric disorders. We have investigated the in vivo pharmacology of a 
      novel buprenorphine analogue, BU10119, for the first time. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: 
      To determine the opioid pharmacology of BU10119 (0.3-3 mg·kg(-1) , i.p.) in vivo, 
      the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay was applied in adult male CD1 mice. A range 
      of behavioural paradigms was used to investigate the locomotor effects, rewarding 
      properties and antidepressant or anxiolytic potential of BU10119. Additional 
      groups of mice were exposed to a single (1 × 2 h) or repeated restraint stress 
      (3× daily 2 h) to determine the ability of BU10119 to block stress-induced 
      analgesia. KEY RESULTS: BU10119 alone was without any antinociceptive activity. 
      BU10119 (1 mg·kg(-1) ) was able to block U50,488, buprenorphine and 
      morphine-induced antinociception. The κ antagonist effects of BU10119 in the 
      tail-withdrawal assay reversed between 24 and 48 h. BU10119 was without 
      significant locomotor or rewarding effects. BU10119 (1 mg·kg(-1) ) significantly 
      reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-induced hypophagia task and reduced 
      immobility time in the forced swim test, compared to saline-treated animals. 
      There were no significant effects of BU10119 in either the elevated plus maze or 
      the light-dark box. Both acute and repeated restraint stress-induced analgesia 
      were blocked by pretreatment with BU10119 (1 mg·kg(-1) ). Parallel stress-induced 
      increases in plasma corticosterone were not affected. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: BU10119 is a mixed κ/μ receptor antagonist with relatively 
      short-duration κ antagonist activity. Based on these preclinical data, BU10119 
      has therapeutic potential for the treatment of depression and other 
      stress-induced conditions. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed

TI  - Mouse strain differences in opiate reward learning are explained by differences 
      in anxiety, not reward or learning.
PG  - 9077-81
AB  - Gene-targeting techniques to produce null mutations provide a powerful method for 
      evaluating the contribution of particular candidate genes involved in motivation. 
      The embryonic stem cell lines in which homologous recombination is undertaken are 
      derived from 129 mice, but because of the impoverished performance of 129 mice on 
      a number of behavioral tasks, mice chimeric for the mutation are often bred with 
      a C57BL/6 mouse strain. Thus, an examination of both parental strains is 
      important in the study of the knock-out mice. Although the C57BL/6 behavioral 
      phenotype is well documented, details of the 129 phenotype have not been the 
      focus of study until recently. We investigated opiate motivation in both 129/SvJ 
      and C57BL/6J mouse strains to determine whether, and under what circumstances, 
      the 129/SvJ mouse exhibited motivated behavior toward opiates. 129/SvJ mice 
      required both drug and contextual cues to demonstrate morphine conditioned place 
      preferences on test day, whereas C57BL/6J mice required only contextual cues to 
      express opiate place conditioning. Pentobarbital and diazepam but not saline, 
      cocaine, or naloxone could substitute for morphine on test day in 129/SvJ mice, 
      demonstrating that morphine indeed has rewarding motivational valence in the 
      129/SvJ mouse strain. This critical, interoceptive cue in 129/SvJ mice on test 
      day may be the anxiolytic properties of the effective drugs. Therefore, some 
      deficits observed in 129 mice and mice harboring this genetic background may be 
      attributed to high levels of anxiety during the retrieval period rather than to 
      sensory, learning, or motivational deficits.

TI  - Potential anti-anxiety, anti-addictive effects of LY 354740, a selective group II 
      glutamate metabotropic receptors agonist in animal models.
PG  - 1831-9
AB  - Despite there being a lot of biochemical data about metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 
      receptors, our knowledge of the behavioural effects of mGlu receptor 
      agonists/antagonists is still inadequate. LY 354740 is a systemically active 
      agonist of group II mGlu receptors. After peripheral administration, LY 354740 
      produced anxiolytic-like effects in the conflict drinking test in rats and a 
      four-plate test in mice. It was also found that LY 354740 decreased spontaneous 
      locomotor activity in mice, but did not disturb motor coordination. In 
      behavioural models of depression including the despair test and a tail suspension 
      test, LY 354740 did not produce antidepressant-like effects. LY 354740 inhibited 
      the naloxone-induced symptoms of morphine withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice. 
      The above results indicate that agonists of group II mGlu receptors may play a 
      role in the therapy of anxiety and/or drug-dependence states. The brain sites of 
      action of LY 354740 need to be identified and the mechanism of both the above 
      described effects remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Selective interaction of homophtalazine derivatives with morphine.
PG  - 175-83
AB  - Homophtalazines show specific binding sites in the nigrostriatal system and to 
      find their target of action the interactions between these derivatives, nerisopam 
      and girisopam, and chlorpromazine, chlordiazepoxide and morphine were assessed. 
      The compounds did not influence the chlorpromazine induced decrease in motility 
      and catalepsy, nor did they alter the antiaggressive and anticonvulsive action of 
      chlordiazepoxide. However, nerisopam and girisopam augmented the agonist potency 
      of morphine to induce catalepsy or analgesia; they also altered the opioid 
      antagonist potency of naloxone. The naloxone-induced decrease in sucrose 
      consumption in drinking water was augmented by nerisopam and girisopam. It is 
      suggested that a possible target of action of homophtalazines is the opioid 
      signal transduction.

TI  - Anxiolytic effects of acute morphine can be modulated by nitric oxide systems.
PG  - 183-9
AB  - This study was performed to investigate whether nitric oxide (NO) precursor 
      (L-arginine), NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP) and NO synthase 
      inhibitors [N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methylester (L-NAME) and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine 
      (L-NOARG)] modulate morphine-induced anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze. 
      L-Arginine (100, 200 and 300 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and SNAP (4, 8 and 10 mg kg(-1), 
      i.p.) reduced the anxiolytic effect of morphine (20 mg kg(-1), s.c.). L-NAME (10, 
      20 and 40 mg/kg, i.p.) and L-NOARG (10, 15 and 20 mg kg(-1), i.p.) enhanced the 
      anxiolytic effects of morphine (20 mg kg(-1), s.c.). On the other hand, 
      L-arginine and SNAP increased the morphine-induced locomotor activity. L-NAME 
      decreased the morphine-induced locomotor activity, but L-NOARG did not modify the 
      morphine-induced locomotor activity. Therefore, these results suggest that the 
      anxiolytic effects of morphine can be modulated by NO systems.

TI  - Changes in analgesia-producing mechanism of repeated cold stress loading in mice.
PG  - 261-6
AB  - Functional changes in opioid receptors involved in analgesia of repeated cold 
      stress (RCS)-loaded mice were investigated. The antinociceptive potency of 
      morphine (4 mg/kg, PO) was not affected in normal mice by norbinaltorphimine (10 
      mg/kg, SC), but treatment with this agent resulted in a lower level of 
      morphine-induced antinociception in RCS-loaded animals. The antinociceptive 
      activity of U-50488H (3 mg/kg, SC) was increased in RCS-loaded mice. In contrast 
      to hypersensitivity to U-50488H (1 and 10 microg, IT) noted in RCS-loaded mice, 
      the antinociception induced by DAMGO (0.1 and 1 microg, ICV) was reduced compared 
      to that of normal animals. Diazepam (1 mg/kg/day SC) was given during RCS 
      loading, and this agent prevented the development of hyperalgesia and the 
      decrease in the antinociceptive activity of DAMGO (1 microg, ICV) in RCS-loaded 
      mice, but there was no effect on the enhancement of the antinociceptive potency 
      of U-50488H (10 microg, IT). These results indicate that the RCS-loaded mice were 
      hyposensitive to supraspinal mu-opioid receptor-mediated antinociception, whereas 
      their antinociceptive activities through kappa-opioid receptor in the spinal cord 
      were increased. Hypofunction of the supraspinal mu-opioid receptor due to anxiety 
      may explain the mechanism involved in the lowering of the nociceptive threshold 
      in RCS-loaded animals.

      in mice at lower doses than other benzodiazepines tested. This behavioral profile 
      suggests that lorazepam will be an active anti-anxiety agent in man at low doses.

PG  - 159-68
AB  - Mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and emergence of withdrawal syndrome 
      are not yet fully understood despite of a huge accumulation of experimental and 
      clinical data. Several clinical features of withdrawal syndrome are considered to 
      be common (i.e., anxiety) among patients with drug dependence induced by 
      different drugs of abuse. In this review, we have discussed the possibility of 
      the functional involvement of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous 
      neuropeptide for benzodiazepine receptors with endogenously anxiogenic potential, 
      in the development of drug dependence and emergence of its withdrawal symptom. 
      The levels of DBI protein and its mRNA significantly increased in the brain 
      derived from mice dependent on alcohol (ethanol), nicotine and morphine, and 
      abrupt cessation of these drugs facilitated further increase in DBI expression. 
      In the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice, concomitant administration 
      of antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and opioid receptors, respectively, 
      abolished the increase in DBI expression. Therefore, these alterations in DBI 
      expression have a close relationship with formation of drug dependence and/or 
      emergence of withdrawal syndrome and are considered to be a common biochemical 
      process in drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse.

TI  - Apparent antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of GYKI 52466.
PG  - 143-54
AB  - GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) 
      was examined in a battery of analgesia and anti-inflammatory tests in rats and 
      mice, respectively. Its 3-N-acetyl (GYKI 53773) and 3-N-methylcarbamoyl (GYKI 
      53784) derivatives were also examined in some assays. These 2,3-benzodiazepines, 
      known as prototypic non-competitive antagonists of AMPA receptors, showed a 
      peculiar profile in some routinely used antinociceptive tests. They were found 
      fairly potent in rat tail flick and mouse phenylquinone writhing assays but the 
      dose-response curves were rather shallow as compared to that of morphine. Their 
      action is stereoselective, i.e., the (+) isomers were found inactive, in 
      agreement with the previous in vitro studies. Their antinociceptive effect could 
      not be reversed by naloxone and the GYKI compounds did not potentiate 
      significantly the morphine-induced analgesia. In the mouse hot plate assay the 
      2,3-benzodiazepines were active only in doses inducing visible motor 
      incapacitation. In rats, GYKI 52466 weakly reduced the hypersensitivity 
      accompanying acute carrageenan edema. However, it potently inhibited the 
      hyperalgesia during Freund adjuvant-induced chronic arthritis. In the latter 
      assay GYKI 52466 also attenuated the body weight loss without altering the paw 
      edema. The present findings confirm reports in the literature which indicate AMPA 
      receptors may contribute to certain forms of pathological hyperalgesia, e.g., to 
      that detectable in inflamed tissues.

TI  - [Pharmacological action of bromazepam suppository].
PG  - 149-65
AB  - Differences between the pharmacological effects of bromazepam given by oral and 
      rectal administration were investigated in mice and rats. 1) Bromazepam 
      dose-dependently prolonged the sleeping time induced by thiopental-Na, ethanol 
      and ether by both administration routes. 2) The analgesic action of bromazepam 
      was recognized by the hot-plate method and the algolytic test. In the hot-plate 
      test, analgesic actions of morphine and pentazocine were potentiated by 
      bromazepam in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg by both routes. 3) The muscle relaxant effect 
      of bromazepam administered rectally was more potent than that administered orally 
      in the inclined screen test and the rotarod test. This effect of bromazepam by 
      rectal administration was approximately 2 times as potent as that by oral 
      administration. 4) Bromazepam inhibited the convulsion induced by maximum 
      electric shock, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin. In pentylenetetrazol-induced 
      convulsion, the inhibitory effect of bromazepam administered rectally was 2 times 
      as potent as that administered orally. In the other convulsion test, no 
      significant differences between oral and rectal administration could be 
      recognized. 5) Hyperemotionality and muricide (mouse-killing behaviour) of rats 
      with bilateral olfactory bulb ablations (OB rat) were reduced by oral and rectal 
      administrations of bromazepam in a dose-dependent manner. The effects by rectal 
      administration were more potent than that by oral administration. Bromazepam was 
      approximately 20 times as potent as diazepam administered by the same route. 
      Fighting behaviour in mice subjected to footshock was suppressed by rectal 
      administration of bromazepam, and this effect was as same as that by oral 
      administration. 6) The rate of lever pressing response in the lateral 
      hypothalamic self-stimulation test in the Skinner box was markedly increased by 
      rectal administration of 0.2 mg/kg bromazepam. 7) Methamphetamine-induced 
      hyperactivity of mice was significantly suppressed only by bromazepam 
      administered rectally in a dose of 5 mg/kg. 8) The falling effect of bromazepam 
      on body temperature in normal rats was the same in both administration routes and 
      was dose-dependent. From these data, significant differences of the 
      pharmacological effects between oral and rectal administration of bromazepam were 
      recognized in the duration of action and, in part, potencies; and therefore, 
      rectal administration of bromazepam may be a useful dosage form for clinical use.

TI  - Neuropeptide S produces antinociceptive effects at the supraspinal level in mice.
PG  - 90-5
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2009.03.013 [doi]
AB  - Neuropeptide S (NPS), a recently identified bioactive peptide through reverse 
      pharmacology approach, was reported to regulate arousal, anxiety, locomotor 
      activity, feeding behaviors and drug reward. NPS receptor (NPSR) mRNA was found 
      in the area related to the descending control system of pain, such as the 
      periaqueductal gray (PAG), raphe nuclei, and lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN), 
      suggesting a possible role of the NPS-NPSR system in the regulation of pain 
      transmission. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of NPS in pain 
      modulation at the supraspinal level for the first time, using the tail withdrawal 
      test and hot-plate test in mice. NPS (mouse, 0.01-1 nmol) injected 
      intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) caused a significant increase of tail 
      withdrawal latency and paw-licking/jumping latency in the tail withdrawal test 
      and the hot-plate test, respectively. Antinociceptive effect elicited by NPS (0.1 
      nmol, i.c.v.) was not affected by naloxone (i.c.v., 10 nmol co-injection or i.p., 
      10 mg/kg, 10 min prior to NPS) in both tail withdrawal test and hot-plate test. 
      However, at the doses, naloxone significantly inhibited the antinociceptive 
      effect induced by morphine (i.c.v., 3 nmol). NPS (0.1 nmol, i.c.v.)-induced 
      antinociception was inhibited by co-injection with 10 nmol, but not 3 nmol 
      [D-Cys(tBu)(5)]NPS, a peptidergic antagonist identified more recently, while 
      [D-Cys(tBu)(5)]NPS (3 and 10 nmol) alone induced neither hyperalgesia nor 
      antinociception. These results revealed that NPS could produce antinociception 
      through NPS receptor, but not opioid receptor, and NPS-NPSR system could be a 
      potential target for developing new analgesic drugs.

TI  - Influence of different benzodiazepines on the experimental morphine abstinence 
      syndrome.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - The abuse of benzodiazepines by narcotic addicts has been well documented. 
      However, the pharmacological basis of this abuse is not clear. In this study the 
      effects of different benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam: 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg; 
      nitrazepam: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; diazepam: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; 
      chlordiazepoxide: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; and triazolam: 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) 
      on the morphine withdrawal syndrome in mice have been compared. Drugs were 
      administered 30 min before naloxone-induced withdrawal. All benzodiazepines 
      tested induced similar changes in some of the signs of morphine abstinence: 
      decreased jumping behavior and increased wet dog shake frequency. Jumping 
      behavior was particularly decreased by triazolam and wet dog shakes were mainly 
      increased by flunitrazepam and nitrazepam. Forepaw treading was reduced by 
      flunitrazepam, diazepam and triazolam, increased by nitrazepam and not changed by 
      chlordiazepoxide. Tremor was effectively reduced by diazepam but less reliably by 
      the other benzodiazepines. Teeth chattering was reduced by flunitrazepam and 
      diazepam. These results indicate that benzodiazepines can interfere with the 
      expression of the morphine withdrawal syndrome.

AB  - Photoallodynia (photophobia) occurs when normal levels of light cause pain 
      ranging from uncomfortable to debilitating. The only current treatment for 
      photoallodynia is light avoidance. The first step to understanding the mechanisms 
      of photoallodynia is to develop reliable animal behavioral tests of light 
      aversion and identify the photoreceptors required to initiate this response. A 
      reliable light/dark box behavioral assay was developed that measures light 
      aversion independently from anxiety, allowing direct testing of one endophenotype 
      of photoallodynia in mice. Mice lacking intrinsically photosensitive retinal 
      ganglion cells (ipRGCs) exhibit reduced aversion to bright light, suggesting 
      these cells are the primary circuit for light aversion. Mice treated with 
      exogenous μ opiate receptor agonists exhibited dramatically enhanced light 
      aversion, which was not dependent on ipRGCs, suggesting an alternative pathway 
      for light is engaged. Morphine enhances retinal electrophysiological responses to 
      light but only at low levels. This suggests that for the dramatic light aversion 
      observed, opiates also sensitize central brain regions of photoallodynia. Taken 
      together, our results suggest that light aversion has at least two dissociable 
      mechanisms by which light causes specific allodynia behaviors: a primary 
      ipRGC-based circuit, and a secondary ipRGC-independent circuit that is unmasked 
      by morphine sensitization. These models will be useful in delineating upstream 
      light sensory pathways and downstream avoidance pathways that apply to 
      photoallodynia.

AB  - Experiencing early-life stress has been considered as a potent risk factor for 
      the development of many of brain disorders, including seizures. Intervening 
      mechanisms through which neonatal maternal separation (MS) alters the seizure 
      susceptibility in adulthood have not been well studied. In the current study, by 
      applying 180 min of MS stress (PND 2-14), we determined the seizure 
      susceptibility and considered the role of the opioid system. Maternal separation 
      increased the seizure threshold, and administration of 
      anticonvulsant/proconvulsant doses of morphine (1 and 30 mg/kg, respectively) 
      reversed the impact of MS. Using tail flick and hot plate tests, we exposed 
      animals to 30 min Restraint stress (RS) and found that MS decreased the pain 
      threshold, suggesting the hyporesponsiveness of the opioid system. These results 
      supported the abnormal seizure activity observed in the MS mice and suggested 
      that abnormalities in the opioid system following MS alter seizure susceptibility 
      in later life.

TI  - [Modifications of several pharmacological actions by diabetes: effects on the 
      opioid receptor agonist and benzodiazepines].
PG  - 121-9
AB  - Diabetic neuropathy is a most-convoluted complication. Diabetic gastropathy, 
      ulcers, diarrhea, and bladder dysfunction are the major peripheral neuropathies. 
      Peripheral neuropathies have been the primary neuroscience focus of diabetes 
      research. In contrast to the periphery, the brain is not usually thought to be a 
      target of chronic diabetic complications. However, the impact of diabetes 
      mellitus on the central nervous system has recently gained attention. It is well 
      known that diabetes or hyperglycemia influences the sensitivity of laboratory 
      animals to various pharmacological agents. An increased sensitivity of 
      hyperglycemic or diabetic animals to barbiturates and a decreased sensitivity of 
      D-amphetamine, p-chloroamphetamine, and carbon tetrachloride have been 
      demonstrated. Furthermore, it was reported that mice and rats with 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetes and spontaneously diabetic mice are significantly 
      less sensitive than non-diabetic mice to the antinociceptive effect of morphine. 
      However, little information is available regarding the mechanism responsible for 
      these changes. It is well established that anxiety and depression are common in 
      patients with diabetes. Moreover, diabetic animals showed significantly more 
      anxiogenic activity than non-diabetic animals did. However, the mechanisms 
      through which diabetes may contribute to the development of, or be a risk factor 
      for, psychiatric disorders are not clear. We provide an overview of our current 
      understanding of the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the opioid 
      receptor and the benzodiazepine receptor.

TI  - The four-plates test: anxiolytic or analgesic paradigm?
PG  - 873-80
AB  - The four-plates test (FPT) is an animal model of anxiety in which the exploration 
      of the novel surroundings is suppressed by the delivery of a mild electric foot 
      shock. The anti-nociceptive system has been reported to be activated by a variety 
      of stressful stimuli such as footshock. The present study was thus designed to 
      compare effects of drugs in the FPT and in the hot-plate test (an animal model of 
      pain), in order to disambiguate the drug-induced anti-punishment effects obtained 
      in the FPT from alterations in pain sensitivity. Various compounds, known to be 
      implicated in anxiety states as well as nociception, have been studied. Although 
      morphine induced a strong anti-nociceptive effect, it did not modify the number 
      of shocks received in the FPT. Alprazolam and diazepam induced an anxiolytic-like 
      effect in the FPT, at doses that did not induce any effect in the hot-plate test. 
      The antidepressants previously reported anxiogenic (desipramine, maprotiline) in 
      the FPT were found to be analgesic at the same doses. Milnacipran, venlafaxine 
      and paroxetine did not modify the pain threshold, whereas they have previously 
      been shown to induce anxiolytic-like effects in the FPT. The dopaminergic 
      antidepressant agent nomifensine was without effect on both tests. Our results 
      suggest that the reported drug-induced anti-punishment effects in the FPT are not 
      related to modifications of pain threshold but to a pure anxiolytic-like effect.

TI  - In vivo inhibition of neuropeptide FF agonism by BIBP3226, an NPY Y1 receptor 
      antagonist.
PG  - 2207-13
AB  - BIBP3226 {(R)-N2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methyl]-argininamide} was 
      recently shown to display relatively high affinities for neuropeptide FF (NPFF) 
      receptors and exhibit antagonist activities towards NPFF receptors in vitro. The 
      present study was undertaken to investigate the antagonistic effects of BIBP3226 
      on several in vivo pharmacologic profiles induced by exogenous NPFF and NPVF. (1) 
      BIBP3226 (5 nmol) injected into the third ventricle completely antagonized the 
      hypothermic effects of NPFF (30 nmol) and NPVF (30 nmol) after cerebral 
      administration in mice; (2) BIBP3226 (5 nmol, i.c.v.) prevented the anti-morphine 
      actions of NPFF (10 nmol, i.c.v.) in the mouse tail-flick assay; (3) in 
      urethane-anaesthetized rats, both NPFF (200 nmol/kg, i.v.) and NPVF (200 nmol/kg, 
      i.v.) increased the mean arterial blood pressure, which were significantly 
      reduced by pretreatment with BIBP3226 (500 nmol/kg, i.v.). Collectively, these 
      data suggest that BIBP3226, a mixed antagonist of NPY Y1 and NPFF receptors, 
      shows in vivo antagonistic effects on NPFF receptors. In addition, it seems to be 
      clear that the in vivo pharmacological profiles of NPFF are mediated directly by 
      NPFF receptors.

TI  - The staircase test: some evidence of nonspecificity for anxiolytics.
PG  - 14-9
AB  - In the staircase test, a naive mouse is placed in a Plexiglas chamber containing 
      a five-step staircase, and the number of rearings and steps climbed are recorded 
      for 3 min. A claim for drug-class specificity has been made because conventional 
      anxiolytics reduced rearings at doses that did not reduce steps climbed, while 
      non-anxiolytics affected both measures in parallel. In the present study 
      chlordiazepoxide, meprobamate, and ethanol registered the expected true positive 
      effect by reducing rearings at doses that did not reduce steps climbed. Nicotine, 
      which has some clinical anxiolytic action, registered a small true positive. The 
      benzodiazepine anxiolytic alprazolam reduced both measures, a false negative, 
      although it reduced rearings more than steps climbed. The putative novel 
      anxiolytics CGS 9896, ketanserine, and tracazolate registered negatives, as did 
      the known clinical anxiolytic buspirone. The non-anxiolytics phencyclidine and 
      phenacetin registered true negatives, but morphine registered a clear false 
      positive. The anxiogenics FG 7142 and pentylenetetrazol produced no significant 
      effects. Because of the equivocal false negative for alprazolam, the clear false 
      negative for buspirone, and the clear false positive for morphine, we concluded 
      that the test lacks the degree of therapeutic-class specificity previously 
      proposed but may still be useful in basic research.

TI  - Involvement of the K+-Cl- co-transporter KCC2 in the sensitization to 
      morphine-induced hyperlocomotion under chronic treatment with zolpidem in the 
      mesolimbic system.
PG  - 747-55
LID - 10.1111/jnc.12258 [doi]
AB  - Benzodiazepines are commonly used as sedatives, sleeping aids, and anti-anxiety 
      drugs. However, chronic treatment with benzodiazepines is known to induce 
      dependence, which is considered related to neuroplastic changes in the mesolimbic 
      system. This study investigated the involvement of K(+) -Cl(-) co-transporter 2 
      (KCC2) in the sensitization to morphine-induced hyperlocomotion after chronic 
      treatment with zolpidem [a selective agonist of γ-aminobutyric acid A-type 
      receptor (GABAA R) α1 subunit]. In this study, chronic treatment with zolpidem 
      enhanced morphine-induced hyperlocomotion, which is accompanied by the 
      up-regulation of KCC2 in the limbic forebrain. We also found that chronic 
      treatment with zolpidem induced the down-regulation of protein phosphatase-1 
      (PP-1) as well as the up-regulation of phosphorylated protein kinase C γ (pPKCγ). 
      Furthermore, PP-1 directly associated with KCC2 and pPKCγ, whereas pPKCγ did not 
      associate with KCC2. On the other hand, pre-treatment with furosemide (a KCC2 
      inhibitor) suppressed the enhancing effects of zolpidem on morphine-induced 
      hyperlocomotion. These results suggest that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system 
      could be amenable to neuroplastic change through a pPKCγ-PP-1-KCC2 pathway by 
      chronic treatment with zolpidem.

TI  - Opioid benzodiazepine tifluadom and drug-induced hyperactivity in mice: lack of 
      benzodiazepine-like effects.
PG  - 585-90
AB  - The opioid benzodiazepine, tifluadom, and the benzodiazepine tranquilizer, 
      diazepam, were compared for their influence on morphine and scopolamine-induced 
      locomotor stimulation in mice. Diazepam enhanced drug-induced hyperactivity, 
      while tifluadom had no effect or reduced locomotor activity. The results 
      demonstrate that tifluadom, a benzodiazepine compound possessing opiate-like 
      analgesic properties, is devoid of either benzodiazepine or morphine-like effects 
      in activity tests.

TI  - Attenuation of benzodiazepine dependence in mice by a tri-substituted 
      benzoflavone moiety of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus: a non-habit forming 
      anxiolytic.
PG  - 215-22
AB  - PURPOSE: A tri-substituted benzoflavone moiety (BZF) recently isolated from the 
      methanol extract of aerial parts of the plant Passiflora incarnata Linneaus had 
      exhibited encouraging results in countering the dependence produced by 
      addiction-prone substances like morphine, nicotine, cannabinoids and ethyl 
      alcohol, during the studies performed by the authors. Since the BZF moiety had 
      exhibited significant anxiolytic properties at 10 mg/kg p.o. dose in mice, 
      therefore, it was desirable to evaluate this potential phyto-moiety (BZF) for its 
      own dependence-liabilities It was also deemed viable to evaluate BZF moiety for 
      its possible usefulness in countering the dependence-liabilities associated with 
      the chronic use of benzodiazepines keeping in light their tremendous clinical use 
      in the management of anxiety and insomnia. METHODS: Different groups of mice were 
      administered BZF alone (10, 50 or 100 mg/kg, p.o.), and concomitantly with 
      diazepam (20 mg/kg, p.o.) in a 21-days treatment regimen, followed by no 
      treatments for the next 72-hours. The withdrawal effects in the form of 
      ambulatory behavior of the treated animals were recorded on the 25th day using an 
      Actophotometer. RESULTS: The BZF-alone (three doses) treated mice exhibited a 
      normal ambulatory behavior on 25th day. Mice groups receiving co-treatments, 
      i.e., BZF-diazepam concomitantly, also exhibited a normal ambulatory behavior in 
      a dose-dependent manner, i.e., the higher dose of BZF (100 mg/kg) being more 
      effective in countering the withdrawal effects of chronically administered 
      diazepam than the lower doses (10 or 50 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: The studies revealed 
      that the chronic administration of the BZF moiety (three doses), did not exhibit 
      any dependence-liability of its own, even upon an abrupt cessation. Additionally, 
      the BZF co-treatments with diazepam also prevented the incurrence of 
      diazepam-dependence, which might be because of the aromatase enzyme inhibiting 
      properties associated with the BZF moiety.

TI  - In vivo evaluation of substituted 3-amino-1,4-benzodiazepines as anti-depressant, 
      anxiolytic and anti-nociceptive agents.
PG  - 61-71
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1296366 [doi]
AB  - Oxazepam (CAS 604-75-1) 4a served as building block in the synthesis of 
      substituted 3-amino-1,4-benzodiazepines, which were subsequently tested in 
      various CNS animal models. The hydroxy group of oxazepam was either activated as 
      a chloride (Method A) or as a phosphor-oxy derivative (Method B) giving the 
      desired 3-amino-1,4-benzodiapines 6a-6r in high yields with primary and secondary 
      amines in a typical nucleophilic substitution reaction. Eighteen 3-substituted 
      1,4-benzodiazepines were prepared and served as new chemical entities and for 
      lead structure discovery. The mixed cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist 6e showed 
      anxiolytic and antidepressant effects from 10 microg/kg in mice in the elevated 
      x-maze test and the forced swimming test. The CCK1 antagonist 6 g has shown 
      antidepressant effects from the same dose, but lacked anxiolytic properties. Both 
      compounds potentiated at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg morphine antinociception with a 
      maximum possible effect (MPE) about 35%. By assessing initially the MPE of 
      antinocipection for the 18 newly synthesised benzodiazepines in the tail-flick 
      test, 4 other benzodiazepines were found active. In further in vive evaluation 
      the cyclohexyl derivative 6 i displayed anxiolytic, antidepressant and 
      antinociceptive properties as single agent at a dose of 5 mg/kg without toxicity. 
      The benzodiazepines 6i and 6p, which initially showed a higher MPE in terms of 
      morphine potentiation (43/44%) showed analgesic effects as single agents, without 
      having anxiolytic or antidepressant properties. The amino-piperidinyl derivative 
      6p displayed a similar dose-response relationship to morphine, but was 3 times 
      more potent.

TI  - CREB activity in the nucleus accumbens shell controls gating of behavioral 
      responses to emotional stimuli.
PG  - 11435-40
AB  - The transcription factor cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) has 
      been shown to regulate neural plasticity. Drugs of abuse activate CREB in the 
      nucleus accumbens, an important part of the brain's reward pathways, and local 
      manipulations of CREB activity have been shown to affect cocaine reward, 
      suggesting an active role of CREB in adaptive processes that follow exposure to 
      drugs of abuse. Using CRE-LacZ reporter mice, we show that not only rewarding 
      stimuli such as morphine, but also aversive stimuli such as stress, activate 
      CRE-mediated transcription in the nucleus accumbens shell. Using viral-mediated 
      gene transfer to locally alter the activity of CREB, we show that this 
      manipulation affects morphine reward, as well as the preference for sucrose, a 
      more natural reward. We then show that local changes in CREB activity induce a 
      more general syndrome, by altering reactions to anxiogenic, aversive, and 
      nociceptive stimuli as well. Increased CREB activity in the nucleus accumbens 
      shell decreases an animal's responses to each of these stimuli, whereas decreased 
      CREB activity induces an opposite phenotype. These results show that 
      environmental stimuli regulate CRE-mediated transcription within the nucleus 
      accumbens shell, and that changes in CREB activity within this brain area 
      subsequently alter gating between emotional stimuli and their behavioral 
      responses. This control appears to be independent of the intrinsic appetitive or 
      aversive value of the stimulus. The potential relevance of these data to 
      addiction and mood disorders is discussed.

TI  - Benzodiazepine-induced antagonism of opioid antinociception may be abolished by 
      spinalization or blockade of the benzodiazepine receptor.
PG  - 505-9
AB  - The mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine antagonism of opioid antinociception 
      were studied using the tail flick test and the hot plate test in mice. Both 
      single-dose and repeated diazepam treatment antagonized the antinociceptive 
      effect of morphine. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil completely 
      reversed the antagonism between diazepam and morphine. Mid-thoracic spinalization 
      also abolished the antagonism, indicating that the antagonism takes place at 
      higher levels in the CNS. Neither diazepam nor midazolam showed any affinity for 
      opioid mu or kappa receptors in membranes prepared from mouse forebrain. Taken 
      together with the results of other studies of interactions between GABAergic 
      drugs and opioids, the results indicate that a benzodiazepine receptor-mediated 
      mechanism at higher levels in the CNS, possibly in the brainstem, blocks the 
      effect of opioids on nociceptive transmission.

TI  - Effect of benzodiazepines on the central action of narcotic analgesics.
PG  - 135-44
AB  - The effects of benzodiazepine (mainly diazepam) on the following central action 
      of narcotic analgesics were tested: antinociceptive action (Randall-Selitto and 
      hot plate tests), hypermotility, inhibition of methylphenidate stereotypy, 
      catalepsy. Diazepam, in doses not affecting the pain threshold markedly 
      potentiated morphine, codeine, etorphine, pentazocine and fentanyl 
      antinociception. Hypermotility produced by morphine and fentanyl was inhibited by 
      pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and clonazepam. Diazepam potentiated 
      the inhibitory effect of opiates on methylphenidate-induced stereotyped gnawing 
      in mice and increased the catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl in rats. In 
      all experiments the effects of diazepam were suppressed by the substances which 
      impair GABA-ergic neurotransmission: bicuculline and picrotoxin. Obtained results 
      indicate that benzodiazepine potentiate the antinociceptive and cataleptogenic 
      effects of opiates and their inhibitory influence on methylphenidate stereotypy. 
      However, these drugs antagonize locomotor hyperactivity in mice. All these 
      actions seem to be related to facilitation of GABA-ergic neurotransmission by 
      benzodiazepines.

TI  - Effect of ethanolic extract of Zingiber officinale Roscoe on central nervous 
      system activity in mice.
PG  - 664-669
AB  - Zingiber officinale Roscoe, commonly known as ginger, is a traditional herb used 
      to treat various disorders. In this study, we evaluated potential pharmacological 
      effects of ethanolic extracts of Z. Officinale with respect to central nervous 
      system (CNS) activity in mice. Role of ethanolic extract of ginger on CNS 
      activity in mice was studied using models of elevated plus maze test, 
      barbiturate-induced sleeping time, tail suspension test, hot-plate and tail-flick 
      test. Ginger extract was administered to mice at single doses of 50 and 200 
      mg/kg, perorally while diazepam (1 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg) and imipramine (30 
      mg/kg) intraperitoneally were used as standard drugs. The results showed that the 
      ginger extract at all dose levels significantly exhibited anxiolytic 
      activityincreased the sleeping latency but reduced the sleeping time. Tail 
      suspension test showed that the extract at both the doses was able to induce a 
      significant decrease in the immobility time, similar to imipramine, a recognized 
      antidepressant drug. Tail-flick and hot-plate tests demonstrated antinociceptive 
      property of ginger extract, similar to morphine, a recognized antinociceptive 
      agent. Higher dose level (200 mg/kg) showed better protective effects. 
      Phytochemical screening of ethanolic extract revealed the presence of various 
      phytoconstituents such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, 
      carbohydrates, glycosides, proteins, resins and volatile oils. The possible 
      mechanism by which ginger exhibited the significant beneficial effects on various 
      CNS models in mice could be attributed to its antioxidant potential.

TI  - Antinociceptive effects of elevated plus-maze exposure: influence of opiate 
      receptor manipulations.
PG  - 507-13
AB  - It has been suggested that anxiety may be a critical factor in certain forms of 
      non-opioid environmental analgesia. In the present study, 5-min exposure to the 
      elevated plus-maze test of anxiety (EPM) induced a mild, though enduring, 
      elevation in tail-flick latencies in male mice. Pretreatment with the opiate 
      antagonist naltrexone (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) failed to block EPM-induced 
      antinociception: indeed, the highest dose actually enhanced the response. This 
      effect could not be attributed to intrinsic analgetic activity of naltrexone. 
      Rather, analysis of EPM behaviours suggested that it may have been secondary to 
      an anxiogenic effect of the compound. The involvement of non-opioid substrates in 
      the form of pain inhibition was further supported by the failure of chronic 
      morphine treatment (7 days; 7.5 mg/kg) to alter either the antinociceptive or 
      behavioural response to EPM exposure. Irrespective of treatment history, mice 
      showed a retest EPM profile of enhanced anxiety, with tail-flick data suggesting 
      a major contribution of anticipatory factors. Several important methodological 
      variables are discussed and findings are contrasted with parallel studies on 
      non-opioid defeat analgesia.

TI  - The anxiolytic effect of acute ethanol or diazepam exposure is unaltered in 
      mu-opioid receptor knockout mice.
PG  - 755-60
AB  - Previous researchers demonstrate an opioidergic involvement in the anxiolytic and 
      rewarding actions of ethanol and diazepam. Therefore, to further characterize the 
      role of the opioid system in the anxiolytic action of ethanol and diazepam, 
      normal (C57BL/6J), hybrid (B6129F1) and mu-opioid receptor knockout mice were 
      given i.p. ethanol (0, 1.0 or 1.6 g/kg) or diazepam (1.5 mg/kg). The anxiolytic 
      properties of these agents were then tested in the elevated plus-maze. Additional 
      ethanol-treated mu-opioid receptor knockout mice (1 g/kg) were pretreated with 
      the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist nor-BNI (0 or 3 mg/kg) to assess the 
      involvement of kappa-opioid activity in ethanol's anxiolytic actions. The 
      anxiolytic action of ethanol and diazepam in the mu-opioid receptor knockout 
      mouse did not differ from the effects obtained in normal mice and pretreatment 
      with nor-BNI did not significantly attenuate ethanol's actions in mu-opioid 
      receptor knockout mice. Thus, the anxiolytic actions of ethanol and diazepam 
      appear to be independent of opioid system activity in the mu-opioid receptor 
      knockout mouse.

TI  - Naloxone blocks anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines in Swiss but not in 
      Balb/c mice.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - The ability of naloxone to block the effects of the benzodiazepines 
      chlordiazepoxide and diazepam was evaluated in Swiss and Balb/c mice subjected to 
      the light/dark choice test of anxiety or to a choice paradigm for measuring 
      spontaneous exploratory behaviour. In Swiss mice, naloxone (5 or 10 mg/kg) 
      completely or partially suppressed the anxiolytic-like effects of 
      chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg) in the light/dark test. 
      Naloxone alone was ineffective. None of these compounds affected locomotion in 
      the free exploratory test. In Balb/c mice, naloxone did not reduce the 
      anxiolytic-like action of benzodiazepines in the light/dark test. Moreover, 
      naloxone did not antagonize the decrease in neophobia observed after anxiolytic 
      treatment in Balb/c mice in the free exploratory paradigm. In this strain, 
      benzodiazepines produced an increase of locomotor activity, whereas naloxone 
      decreased it. The stimulant effects of benzodiazepines on locomotor activity were 
      abolished by naloxone. As naloxone (2 mg/kg) reversed the morphine-induced 
      hyperthermia both in Swiss and in Balb/c mice, differences in possible 
      pharmacokinetic factors between the two strains can be ruled out as an 
      explanation for the failure of naloxone to antagonize anxiolytic-like effects in 
      Balb/c mice. Therefore, the ability of naloxone to reverse anxiolytic effects 
      does not hold for all strains of mice.

TI  - Effect of the selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist JDTic on nicotine 
      antinociception, reward, and withdrawal in the mouse.
PG  - 285-94
LID - 10.1007/s00213-010-1803-1 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Several lines of evidence support a role for the endogenous opioid 
      system in mediating behaviors associated with drug dependence. Specifically, 
      recent findings suggest that the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) may play a role in 
      aspects of nicotine dependence, which contribute to relapse and continued tobacco 
      smoking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the involvement 
      of the KOR in the initial behavioral responses of nicotine, nicotine reward, and 
      nicotine withdrawal using the highly selective KOR antagonist JDTic. JDTic doses 
      of 1, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg were administered subcutaneously (s.c.) 18 h prior to 
      nicotine treatment. RESULTS: JDTic dose-dependently blocked acute 
      nicotine-induced antinociception in the tail-flick but not the hot-plate test and 
      did not significantly attenuate morphine's antinociceptive effect in either the 
      tail-flick or hot-plate test. Furthermore, JDTic (8 and 16 mg/kg, s.c.) failed to 
      block the expression of nicotine reward as measured by the conditioned place 
      preference model. In contrast, JDTic and the KOR antagonist norBNI attenuated the 
      expression of both the physical (somatic signs and hyperalgesia) and affective 
      (anxiety-related behavior and conditioned place aversion) nicotine withdrawal 
      signs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings clearly show that the KOR is involved in 
      mediating the withdrawal aspects of nicotine dependence. The results from this 
      study suggest that blockade of the KOR by selective KOR antagonists may be useful 
      smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.

TI  - The use of social interaction as a method for detecting anxiolytic activity of 
      chlordiazepoxide-like drugs.
PG  - 219-38
AB  - The social interaction test in rats provides a method for detecting anxiolytic 
      activity that does not use food or water deprivation, or electric shock, and 
      therefore obviates difficulties of interpretation that might arise from 
      drug-induced changes in motivation. Since social interaction is measured under 
      more than one test condition any overall increase or decrease in social behaviour 
      can be detected independently from the drug x test condition interaction that 
      characterizes an anxiolytic drug. The Geller-Seifter conflict test was designed 
      with two schedules of reinforcement for the same reasons. Any candidate test for 
      anxiolytic action that examines drug effects under only one experimental 
      condition is open to misinterpretation and may also prove unreliable if the 
      critical experimental factors ( e.g. the level of food deprivation or the shock 
      intensity) are changed. The testing procedure in the social interaction test is 
      relatively time consuming in terms of observer-hours, but no lengthy pretraining 
      of the animals is required. There is no way of fully automating the scoring and 
      therefore it is important that the observers do not know the experimental group 
      of the rats that they are scoring, and that tape recordings are made so that the 
      scores can be checked. It has not so far been fruitful to analyze drug effects on 
      every individual social behaviour, but this method does allow changes in 
      individual behaviours to be detected. By entering the data directly into a 
      computer we are now able to store the frequency and duration of each behaviour as 
      well as the sequence of behaviours. It will then be possible to determine whether 
      a detailed analysis of drug effects on the patterning of social behaviours will 
      prove a useful addition to the social interaction test

PG  - 39-42
AB  - A 14-year-old previously fit schoolboy was admitted with staphylococcal pneumonia 
      secondary to influenza A infection. His condition deteriorated as he developed 
      adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); during a stormy recovery 
      exceptionally high doses of benzodiazepines and opiates were given in order to 
      suppress voluntary breathing during a successful period of assisted ventilation. 
      It is possible that benzodiazepine-opiate antagonism developed. Subsequent 
      studies in laboratory mice indicate that the respiratory depressant effects of 
      morphine can be antagonized by prior treatment with lorazepam.

      in mouse cerebral cortex.
PG  - 194-8
AB  - Changes in diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) mRNA expression after withdrawal from 
      nicotine were examined. Withdrawal from nicotine Increased DBI mRNA expression in 
      cerebral cortices derived from nicotine-dependent mice and in the neurons 
      continuously exposed to nicotine (0.1 microM). These results indicate that 
      withdrawal from nicotine after its long-term exposure induces steep increase of 
      DBI mRNA expression as reported previously in ethanol- and morphine-dependent 
      animals.

TI  - Involvement of serotonergic receptor subtypes in the production of 
      antinociception by psychological stress in mice.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - Besides the important role of emotional factors in the production of 
      psychological-stress-induced analgesia (PSY-SIA), recent attention to the 
      participation of serotonergic (5-HTnergic) neurons in the fear- and 
      anxiety-evoking mechanism led us to examine the effects of 5-HTnergic ligands on 
      PSY-SIA. Pretreatment of mice with 2.0 to 10 mg/kg of methysergide, a 5-HT 
      receptor antagonist, or 1.0 to 10 mg/kg of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial 
      agonist, dose-dependently suppressed the production of PSY-SIA. Ritanserin, a 
      5-HT2 receptor antagonist, 1.0 to 5.0 mg/kg, or Y-25,130, a 5-HT3 receptor 
      antagonist, 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, also inhibited PSY-SIA dose-dependently, while 
      (+/-)pindolol, a 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist, was ineffective at doses up to 
      3.0 mg/kg. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of PSY-stress on the development 
      of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine was also antagonized by methysergide, 
      buspirone, ritanserin and Y-25,130, but not by (+/-)pindolol. These results 
      suggest that 5-HT receptor (5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 but not 5-HT1B)-mediated 
      mechanisms play an important role in the production of PSY-SIA.

TI  - A new assay of thermal-based avoidance test in freely moving mice.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - The hot plate test is a standard way to measure nociceptive response latencies to 
      a noxious thermal stimulus. Here we have modified the classic hot plate by 
      allowing animals to escape to an adjacent chamber after exposure to the heated 
      surface. In this test, the animals escape to the adjacent chamber after exposure 
      to the hot plate set at 50 degrees C. Repeated exposure to the hot plate resulted 
      in a facilitation of escape responses, as measured by a reduced latency to escape 
      from the noxious thermal stimulus. Signs of nociceptive behavior, such as licking 
      or jumping, were not affected in animals that received hot plate training. The 
      reduction of escape latencies after repeated hot plate exposure might be a useful 
      measure for studying the facilitation of escape responses. In addition, the 
      modified hot plate described here might be useful in studying performance and 
      memory deficits related to noxious thermal stimuli. PERSPECTIVE: We modified a 
      hot plate to measure facilitation of escape responses to a noxious thermal 
      stimulus. The measure of escape responses might be useful in the assessment of 
      memory defects, evaluation of drug therapies, and the behavioral characterization 
      of transgenic mice.

TI  - Supraspinal neurotensin-induced antianalgesia in mice is mediated by spinal 
      cholecystokinin.
PG  - 141-9
AB  - Intracerebral injection of neurotensin into specific brain loci in rats produces 
      hyperalgesia due to the release of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the spinal cord. The 
      present purpose was to show in another species that neurotensin can antagonize 
      the antinociceptive action of morphine through the spinal CCK mechanism in mice. 
      Neurotensin given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at doses higher than 100 ng 
      produced antinociception in the tail flick test. However, at lower doses between 
      1 pg to 25 ng, neurotensin antagonized the antinociceptive action of morphine 
      given intrathecally (i.t.), thus demonstrating the antianalgesic activity of 
      neurotensin. The rightward shift in the morphine dose-response curve produced by 
      i.c.v. neurotensin was eliminated by an i.t. pretreatment with CCK8 antibody (5 
      microl of antiserum solution diluted 1:1000). I.t. administration of lorglumide, 
      a CCK(A)-receptor antagonist (10-1000 ng), and PD135,158, a CCK(B)-receptor 
      antagonist (250-500 ng), also eliminated the antianalgesic action of neurotensin. 
      Thus, the mechanism of the antianalgesic action of neurotensin given i.c.v. 
      involved spinal CCK. This mode of action is similar to that for the antianalgesic 
      action of supraspinal pentobarbital which also involves spinal CCK.

TI  - Evidence for the involvement of the opioid system in the antidepressant-like 
      effect of folic acid in the mouse forced swimming test.
PG  - 122-7

AB  - The opioid system has been implicated in major depression and in the mechanism of 
      action of antidepressants. This study investigated the involvement of the opioid 
      system in the antidepressant-like effect of the water-soluble B-vitamin folic 
      acid in the forced swimming test (FST). The effect of folic acid (10 nmol/site, 
      i.c.v.) was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 
      nonselective opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (3 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 
      delta-opioid receptor antagonist), naloxonazine (10 mg/kg, i.p., a selective 
      mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonist, 24 h before), but not with naloxone methiodide 
      (1 mg/kg, s.c., a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist). In addition, a 
      sub-effective dose of folic acid (1 nmol/site, i.c.v.) produced a synergistic 
      antidepressant-like effect in the FST with a sub-effective dose of morphine (1 
      mg/kg, s.c.). A further approach was designed to investigate the possible 
      relationship between the opioid system and NMDA receptors in the mechanism of 
      action of folic acid in the FST. Pretreatment of the animals with naloxone (1 
      mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of folic acid 
      (1 nmol/site, i.c.v.) and MK-801 (0.001 mg/kg, i.p., a non-competitive NMDA 
      receptor antagonist). Together the results firstly indicate that the 
      anti-immobility effect of folic acid in the FST is mediated by an interaction 
      with the opioid system (mu(1) and delta), likely dependent on the inhibition of 
      NMDA receptors elicited by folic acid.

TI  - Some central effects of indenolol in experimental animals.
PG  - 201-9
AB  - Indenolol, a relatively new beta-adrenergic blocking drug, was tested for its 
      effect on the central nervous system. The parameters included its effects on 
      spontaneous motor activity, conditioned avoidance response (CAR) acquisition, 
      pentobarbitone hypnosis, amphetamine induced motor excitation, analgesic activity 
      and rectal temperature in experimental animals. Indenolol was found to 
      significantly decrease the spontaneous motor activity in mice and CAR acquisition 
      in rats. It potentiated the pentobarbitone induced hypnosis and antagonized 
      amphetamine induced excitatory behaviour in mice. It did not show a marked 
      analgesic effect of its own but potentiated the analgesia induced by the 
      subanalgesic dose of morphine. It also produced a significant hypothermic effect 
      in mice. All the effects except on CAR acquisition were obtained in the dose of 
      50-75 mg/kg body weight administered intraperitoneally. It enhanced CAR 
      acquisition in the specific dose of 5 mg/kg. These observations indicate that 
      indenolol possesses an anxiolytic effect similar to that reported for propranolol 
      and some other beta-blocking drugs.

TI  - [4-aminopyridine induced rage reaction in mice].
PG  - 155-9
AB  - Rage reaction was induced in mice by sc 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) 6 mg . kg-1. Mice 
      appeared hyperreactive after 8-12 min and then squeaked and fought each other. 
      These manifestations were most distinct in 10-30 min and subsided after 40-60 
      min. The occurrence of rage reaction on this dose level was around 90%. At higher 
      doses 4-AP caused convulsions and death after evocation of rage reaction. The 
      ED50 of 4-AP for eliciting rage reaction was 4.7 +/- 0.7 mg . kg-1 sc. No 
      significant difference in induction of rage reaction was seen between male and 
      female mice of different body weights. Both neuroleptic drugs (chlorpromazine, 
      haloperidol, tarden and clozapine) and anxiolytic drugs (diazepam, 
      chlordiazepoxide, and meprobamate) inhibited 4-AP-induced rage reaction in mice. 
      Barbiturates, Chloral hydrate, methaqualone, morphine hydrochloride, aspirin, 
      phenytoin sodium, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, atropine sulfate, and procaine 
      hydrochloride did not affect rage reaction. The 4-AP-induced aggressive behavior, 
      similar to that induced by electric footshock or isolation, has the merits of 
      convenience to deal with and time saving. Hence we recommended it as a screening 
      method for drugs with neuroleptic and anxiolytic activities.

TI  - [Assessment of anxiolytics (6)--A novel method in mice using psychological 
      stress].
PG  - 375-83
AB  - Both antinociception induced by psychological stress (PSY, using the 
      communication box) and the suppression by the stress of the development of 
      antinociceptive tolerance to morphine were completely extinguished by diazepam 
      (DZP, 1-2 mg/kg), suggesting an essential role of emotional factors in the 
      underlying mechanisms. Based on these findings, a simple and selective method for 
      evaluating anxiolytics was designed. Treatment with methysergide (2-20 mg/kg, 
      ip), buspirone (1-10 mg/kg, ip), ritanserin (1-5 mg/kg, ip), Y-25,130 (0.03-0.1 
      mg/kg, ip) and ICS 205-930 (1-100 micrograms/kg, po), all of which reportedly 
      possess anxiolytic activity, dose-dependently suppressed both the production of 
      PSY stress-induced antinociception (PSY-SIA) and the blockade of the development 
      of morphine tolerance by PSY stress. In contrast to these compounds, 
      (+/-)pindolol (up to 3 mg/kg) and imipramine, even after pretreatment daily with 
      40 mg/kg, ip, for 5 days, produced no such suppression. In an elevated plus-maze 
      (EPM) method, frequently used as a simple method for detecting anxiolytic drugs, 
      not only DZP, buspirone, Y-25,130 and ICS 205-930 but also imipramine (daily with 
      40 mg/kg for 5 days) increased the time spent on the open arms, while 
      methysergide or retanserin failed to augment the time, indicating that the EPM 
      method is not selective for this purpose. Since U-50,488H suppresses the 
      development of morphine tolerance, the utility of the compound for PSY stress was 
      also examined; however, the suppressive effect was counteracted by (+/-)pindolol 
      but not by ritanserin. Thus, we proposed a valid new method for screening 
      anxiolytic drugs in mice, by testing the extinguishable effect of drugs on these 
      parameters, i.e., PSY-SIA and suppression by PSY stress of the development of 
      morphine tolerance.

TI  - Halothane-induced sleeping time in the mouse: its modification by 
      benzodiazepines.
PG  - 103-12
AB  - The conditions under which prolongation of halothane-induced sleeping time in the 
      mouse may be used as a test for centrally acting drugs are described. The test 
      can be recommended for its practical advantages over methods using barbiturates 
      to induce hypnosis; due cognizance must be taken of a diurnal variation in the 
      response of mice to halothane. To assess the usefulness of the test the effects 
      of amphetamine, chlorpromazine, histamine, morphine, nikethamide, pentobarbitone 
      and SKF 525A have been investigated. The interaction between 5 benzodiazepines 
      and halothane has been studied in particular. Results from sleeping time 
      experiments, measurements of body temperature and of brain halothane 
      concentrations suggest that the halothane-benzodiazepine interaction is due to 
      additive CNS depressant effects. It was found that nitrazepam and diazepam were 
      clearly more potent than chlorodiazepoxide, medazepam and oxazepam in respect of 
      their interactions with halothane.

TI  - Antagonistic effects of psycholeptic drugs on stress-induced analgesia.
PG  - 264-74
AB  - Stress-induced analgesia was significantly antagonized by naloxone and was 
      dose-dependently reduced by diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam, medazepam, 
      nitrazepam, estazolam, phenobarbital, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, 
      haloperidol and propranolol. In contrast to psycholeptics, morphine substantially 
      increased in threshold of nociceptive response in the post-stress session. 
      Centrally acting muscle relaxants, tolperisone and carosiprodol had no 
      substantial anti-stress effects. These results suggest that the stress-induced 
      analgesia is probably mediated through endogenous opioids in the central nervous 
      system. The approach used in our study provides a simple method for assessing the 
      anti-stress action of psycholeptics.

TI  - Synthesis and antianxiety activity of (omega-piperazinylalkoxy)indan derivatives.
PG  - 246-50
AB  - A series of (omega-piperazinylalkoxy)indan derivatives has been synthesized and 
      screened for potential antianxiety activities. The effect of structural 
      modification of these molecules on activities has been systemically examined. 
      Antianxiety activity was displayed by 5-[3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)propoxy]indan 
      (2), 5-[3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-propoxy]indan (8), 
      6-fluoro-5-[3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)propoxy]indan (33), and 
      6-methyl-5-[3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)propoxy]indan (42), as determined in 
      antifighting and anti-morphine tests. These derivatives in antianxiety tests were 
      equipotent or more potent than chlordiazepoxide with less muscle-relaxant effect. 
      They also showed weak neuroleptic-like action.

TI  - [Afobazole influence on antinociceptive properties of morphine].
PG  - 22-3
AB  - The effects of afobazole (1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on the antinociceptive 
      properties of morphine (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) were studied in mice. It is shown that 
      afobazole attenuates the analgesic action of morphine in the "hot plate" and 
      "tail flick" tests. This effect was prevented by sigma 1 receptor antagonist 
      haloperidol (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.). Data obtained suggested that a decrease in the 
      morphine antinociceptive action by afobazole is related to its agonistic 
      interaction with sigma 1 receptors at supraspinal and spinal levels.

TI  - Reversal of antinociceptive effect of cholecystokinin by benzodiazepines and a 
      benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Intraperitoneally administered benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (2-5 mg/kg), 
      diazepam (1 mg/kg), flurazepam (1 mg/kg) and a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 
      15-1788 (0.5 mg/kg), reversed the antinociceptive effect in mice which was 
      induced by intracisternal administration of 1 microgram of sulfated 
      cholecystokinin octapeptide. The antinociceptive effect of cholecystokinin was 
      reversed by naloxone, suggesting that the antinociceptive action involves 
      endogenous opioid peptides in its production. On the other hand, morphine-induced 
      analgesia was not reversed by diazepam and Ro 15-1788. These facts rule out 
      opioid receptors as the site of the antagonism between the benzodiazepines or Ro 
      15-1788 and cholecystokinin on the antinociceptive effect. Benzodiazepines and Ro 
      15-1788 seem to inhibit the release of opioid peptides induced by 
      cholecystokinin.
